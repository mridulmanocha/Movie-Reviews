1,"Sad, But Incredibly Beautiful",Kristin Elizabeth,"I went into this movie not having read the book and not knowing anything more than the overall plot. I am a sucker for a good love story, especially love that I can relate to. The pain and emotions felt by the characters felt so real, as if I was feeling the same emotions.<br><br>Though this was THE SADDEST movie I have ever seen, it was also one of the most beautiful, as it truly showed how exhilarating and comforting and exciting love is. <br><br>I probably cried throughout about half of the movie, along with the rest of the audience. I cried to the point of heaving out loud and needing more than the 2 tissues I came in with. Again, the actors really expressed the emotions of the characters well and I felt that. <br><br>I am going to see it again for sure.<br><br>GO SEE IT IF YOU LOVE EMOTIONAL MOVIES!",3 June 2014
2,A Beautiful Love Story: Going to love it for the longest of the infinity,AniConrad,"'Some infinities are bigger than other infinities' says my favorite quote from the movie (and the book) and its true because I am going to love this movie for the longest of the infinity. I am a huge fan of the book and one thing which really makes the movie stand out is an amazing performance by Shailene Woodley. She is outstanding in every scene she is and I have to say I am kind of in love with Hazel. Even though its a love story of a girl who has terminal cancer I wouldn't say that the film is tragic rather the film is about living your life to the fullest in your 'little infinity' If you have already read the book, the film is true to the book and the great acting, directing and music adds another dimension to the story. The Fault In Our Stars is definitely one of the best romantic movies ever. When you see this movie you are going to laugh and you are going to cry and when the end credit roles I can guarantee most of you are going to be completely in love with this love story.",21 July 2014
3,The Joy of Life,horacioreyes,"I was touched by the concepts and situations on this film, being myself a survivor of 48 chemotherapy treatments, I can somehow understand the feelings.<br><br>Is not a pretentious film, however full of little moments that creates a very good and convincing environment.<br><br>I like both main rolls. The story is completely credible, it can happen any time to anyone.<br><br>It is an Ode for Life, it tell us that ""We can and should have moments of infinite joy within a limited time"" It is our choice!<br><br>I liked very much this film!",30 June 2014
4,Would happily see this again!,Victreebong,"Average American guy right here, and I dug this flick. I don't care how many 13 year olds were in the theater with me, this movie has emotion. After watching the Descendents, I knew Woodley was going places. She simply delivers in this movie. I'm not going to write a long winded review about the summary, but I will tell you about the acting.<br><br>Elgort and Woodley truly deliver. You forget they're acting each and every scene. The chemistry between the two is palpable. Laura Dern comes out of nowhere; I think the last time I've seen her face was JP. She puts up a pretty good role as Woodley's torn mother. Defoe is pure love/hate on almost a House level. In fact, he goes beyond House hatred with his apathy in this movie. And the two's sidekick (Wolff) is loads of comic relief, which is surprising considering that he too is in the therapy group. The rest of the cast is just kind of there (sorry Tramell). But that's because the camera is on Woodley and Elgort the entire time. I don't even think there's a scene except for flashbacks where the two are absent.<br><br>As far as the movie... An emotional roller-coaster. You will get addicted to their relationship. You will cry big man tears internally (and probably externally) after 1.5 hours. You will be emotionally drained.",12 June 2014
5,I've Saved my Ten for This Film,Joshua Kho,"Before I continue with this review, please note that I have not read the book, but am going to in the very near future :) Please note that Im also a (straight) guy... not that it matters :P<br><br>Wow what can I say about this movie. From the moment the title sequence starts, I was hooked straight away. Scene to scene this movie just manages to suck me into this beautiful world of Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters. The chemistry between Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elsort is astounding and the performances were astonishing. Honestly, this is the best movie I have seen all year, even better than Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Godzilla which was a massive surprise. I just thought this was going to be another teenie love story and boy was I wrong. I loved this movie and recommend it to everyone across all ages. I'm rambling on and praising the movie now so I should probably get on with the review.<br><br>The direction and cinematography was fantastic. Not a single shot felt odd or out of place. Every shot matched the scene and felt real. The editing was also great as shot after shot matched with the characters faces and where they were (typical good movie editing stuff). <br><br>The acting perhaps was one of the best aspects of this movie. Seriously it makes the two characters feel real and alive, and at times I forgot this was fiction and not based on a true story. Their performances were so heartfelt and definitely Oscar worthy in my opinion. But knowing the academy this is just another teenie love story that will not be acknowledged at all. Hopefully I'm wrong, but thats the way it normally is. <br><br>This is the first movie this year that I have given a 10. I don't give out 10's easily, but there was seriously nothing wrong with this film. The pacing was perfect, the acting was phenomenal, the direction, editing and cinematography was exceptional and overall, this movie is one of the best romantic comedies that have ever touched the face of the earth. I encourage EVERYONE to go see this movie no matter what age you are and bring a packet of tissues as well. You'll need it.<br><br>10/10",4 June 2014
6,Was this shot on film? Cause there's a lot of chemistry involved!,Semidieu,"This movie, simply put, is worth each and every one of its 125 minutes. Including the closing credits, that you need to dry your eyes and think about what you just saw. It's the inspiring story of two young people who are no different then all of us, as they both are in the process of dieing. Though Hazel Grace and Augustus are more aware of this fact of life; because their eternity"" has an expiration date, set by Hazels terminal illness: Cancer. <br><br>As the viewer is put on an emotional roller-coaster, alongside the feelings and attitudes towards life and love the two teens share, this movie will be a key to many locked doors in the recepients minds. And through these doors we are lead by an ensemble of actors who are amazingly sensitive in their portrayal of personalities and emotions.<br><br>The writing and directing is so brilliantly executed, that you have sympathy with every character this movie so caringly brings to (short) life. Even when they oppose another you feel unable to take sides. Because you find yourself sharing both. And when the credits role - like the tears on your cheek - you realize, that these opposing views are one and the same after all: Life.",31 May 2014
7,Bring Kleenex. Lots of Kleenex.,dcbluestar,"Wow. Being an avid book reader, I'm always skeptical about watching the words of my favorite books transformed and materialized on the big screen... but TFIOS stayed true to the book. The movie was absolutely lovely from beginning to end. The young actors were great. The comedy hit on all the right notes, the romance made your heart smile and the tragedy pulled at your heart strings. It really was a wonderful adaptation, and I believe it stayed as true to the book as possible without many changes where there were any. The minute it was over, I wanted to watch it again. Upon leaving the theater, I looked around and there was not one dry eye. Not even the men. If you are a big fan of the book, like myself... and are skeptical about whether this stays true. Don't be. Kudos the John Green on his first film adaptation. It was an absolute success. I'd give it a 10 out of 10 if I could... but I don't believe in ""perfect.""",31 May 2014
8,I've never cried so much in my entire life.,Nicole Yap,"I don't really cry in movies unless they're really, really sad. And this movie is bound to get you crying like there's no tomorrow. I brought a box of tissues and I used about half of them. I have never cried so much in my entire life. Being an avid fan of the book, I was kind of scared that like some of my other favourite books, the movie would be ruined. But no, the movie had all of the book's materials in it (except for one thing). I never thought Shailene and Ansel would play Hazel and Gus, but when I watched it, their performance blew me away. I think Shailene's ability to cry got ME crying, because that's how real it felt. It is an amazing movie, and I'm sorry to say that it's even better than A Walk to Remember. Go see this movie, and if you do, maybe read the book first so that you can be somewhat prepared!",4 June 2014
9,I've never rolled my eyes so much during a movie,Alex Barnes,"The reason I am rating this a 1 is to combat the insane 8.2 rating that this terrible movie has.<br><br>I'm a 17 year old girl, and most people would assume someone my age would fall head over heels for a movie like this. I watched expecting to see this amazingly realistic, incomparable, and tragically beautiful love story, which is how TFIOS had been described to me. After spending two hours watching this movie, I'm sitting here wondering if I'm made of stone considering I did not shed a single tear. But several movies I have watched, and stories I have read, have left me sobbing and attempting to recover for days. I have never read the book, or any of John Green's books for that matter but now I will forever hold the opinion that he is a fully grown man attempting to articulate not only the life of a teenage girl, but the life of someone suffering with a disease. The first few lines of the movie, narrated by Hazel, made me know I was going to hate this movie, since she was describing things that happened in cliché romance stories (which is exactly what this is), and how this was ""true."" The idea that this movie was realistic is ridiculous. First of all, a few token one-liners in the movie were clever and well written, but would never come out of a teenager's mouth. As a teenager myself, I can confirm that we are not that profound. I didn't understand the appeal that either of the main characters had in the other, other than the fact they both had cancer. Hazel was boring, and selfish, and self-pitying, and Gus was so pretentious it made me feel sick, and I never believed for a second that he was a virgin. Of course cancer is a terrible thing, as is death itself, but the fact that I didn't care about either of them, and saw them as a caricature of what John Green thinks or wants teenagers with cancer to act like, made me completely indifferent to their predictable demise. The story line with them going to Amsterdam to visit the author of their favorite book was annoying and unnecessary. Although the author was painted as this terrible person, I actually agreed everything that came out of his mouth about Hazel. I'm pretty sure the whole point of that scene was to say ""hey, what can we do to make this movie even more depressing? I know, let's take the one thing that the main character cares about and destroy it, in order to make her completely dependent on her love interest."" There's too many complaints I have about specific eye-roll inducing lines and scenes in this movie to even remember, but the one that angered me more than anything was when they went to the Anne Frank house. First, they tried to compare the horrible death of Anne Frank and her family, which was an outcome of the most horrible thing that has happened in human history, to these teenagers dying with cancer. As soon as they reached the top floor of the house, paying attention only to Hazel struggling to climb the stairs, in my mind I started thinking ""please make them be respectful. I swear, if Gus tries to crack a self-righteous joke I will punch my laptop screen."" At first, I was pleasantly surprised, because they were quiet and solemn, but then, they begin making out... Only to make it worse, everyone in the room begins clapping. Why? If I was there, I would be furious at their lack of respect. I can only hope this scene wasn't filmed in the actual house. Towards the end I was constantly checking the bar at the bottom of my screen to see how long I had left. I kept thinking, when is this really sad part coming that will make me cry? and when the credits started rolling, I realized it never would. The fact that people are describing this piece of trash as the best movie they have ever seen boggles my mind. I'm assuming it's the first movie they have ever seen. If you want to watch a realistic romance movie, you won't find it here. Don't waste your time.",20 September 2014

I was unfortunate enough to to see it!!<br><br>The acting is terrible, probably the worst I've ever seen.The film is silly and frankly ridiculous.<br><br>The worst thing in the entire movie was in the scene inside the Anne Franks home when they kissed for the first time after a long, tough climb for who never seemed to end.

They didn't know that they had cancer...

11,Artificial movie for an idiotic generation...,navi23,"8.5 on IMDb?!??! Seriously?!?!?!<br><br>You can rate this movie SO high... if you wanna be stimulated emotionally in a gratuitous manner + if your IQ level is REALLY low + if you like actors who can't act and look absolutely artificial on the screen (what the heck happened to Laura Dern? she used to be a slightly better actor... now she looks like she's joined the ranks of the completely artificialized Americans... fake smiles, fake emotions; those kids act completely unrealistic also... this is NOT how people who will die from cancer would behave...). Have someone on the BIG screen cry for a few minutes... the audience will cry too, of course. It's like the yawning that's contagious... But why was it that I didn't care at all for ANY of the characters, by the end of the movie?... The only moment that was a bit moving was when the girl received the news about his death... But even that wasn't connected emotionally to anything else in the movie... I can list a hundred movies that are WAY more emotional than this pile of artificial cr*p...

12,I Saved My 1 For This Film,khaledalasad,"I honestly can't imagine how anyone with a sense of good writing, good directing, or good acting could ever think this movie is entertaining past the humor of its flaws. Do you people have brains? These actors may as well have had the script in their hands while shooting. It would have made no difference. The only impressive ""skills"" displayed came when the girl cries after AUGUSTUS (so pretentious)passes away. <br><br>The only thing that kept me engaged in this movie after I had started watching was the curiosity of which one dies first. There were points when I was rooting for the death of them together just so the movie would end.<br><br>This review isn't coming from someone heartless. I admit that I teared up when Hazel bawls her eyes out, but that doesn't make the movie good. That just means I sympathize with someone who is crying. That says nothing about the quality of the film. <br><br>What happened IMDb? I can usually trust your ratings. I've never written a review here before but when I saw that this was higher than an 8, I had to say something.<br><br>This is a weak tearjerker for the weak-minded.",27 July 2014
13,Too many people are idiots.,o_oraculo,"I give it ""1"" because IMDb doesn't let me give it 0. I never wrote a review before, but seeing the average of 8.5 gave me a feeling of never being able to trust IMDb again.<br><br>I usually check movie scores in IMDb to decide if I should watch it in the theaters. Below 7 is lame (except for comedies which gets lower scores). 7 to 8 maybe. 8 and up must see (except for this movie). Seeing an 8.5 I went to the theater excited. I hope someone like me is out there and reads this review before he wastes his time and money with it.<br><br>What I saw: Boring, depressing, cynic, pessimist, average looking to slightly good looking girl has lung cancer. The audience is led to believe she is smart because she read the same book 1000 times over (doing that isn't smart) and goes to college (which she doesn't really).<br><br>She goes to a support group where good hearted, Christian, cancer survivor (which is made to look like a loser) helps young people who have cancer. <br><br>There, she meets 2 characters: 1) eye cancer guy who is going to have to remove them and has a huge boobed (to good for him) girlfriend, who will leave him 10 minutes later. 2) his friend, an extremely athletic, pretty, extremely confident guy (even though he's a virgin (yeah right *rolls eyes*)) who is also a cancer survivor (lost a leg to it, but is paradoxically still very athletic). <br><br>Even though his value on the meat market is much higher than the protagonist girl's value, he only has eyes for her, even without her saying anything but depressing things.<br><br>At the end of the meeting, if being athletic, pretty and confident isn't enough, a girl passes by him trying to get his attention (to show that even other girls are into him), so that the main girl can be certain that he's an alpha male, but she still give's him a hard time (because in every romantic movie a guy has to prove himself even beyond the shadow of a doubt that he's the man for a boring girl (the exception is when there are 2 awesome guys fighting for the same girl (Twilight))).<br><br>They start talking on the phone and she lends him her favorite book. <br><br>The leg cancer guy says that her book is amazing. And since the spoiled brat cancer girl has some stupid question she wants to make to the author, he decides to get them both a trip to Europe to talk to the writer of the book. He could get anything for himself, but he decides to give his special once in a lifetime cancer wish to her, even though they are not boyfriend/girlfriend, they have not had sex, they haven't even kissed yet.<br><br>Her doctor is the ugliest actor, so you know he's going to be the bad guy. He tells her that she can't take the trip in any possible way! She goes anyway (obviously).<br><br>In the generic romantic European country, the guy decides to use a tux (which all men love to wear... Not!) to take her to a very expensive dinner (which although he doesn't end up having to pay, he was more than happy to be able to pay for her!).<br><br>The author seems to be a reasonable guy, he tells them in other words that the book ended the way it should have ended, that her questions are stupid and that she's a spoiled brat/ narcissist (which is all true).<br><br>She gets sad, boy comforts her and tells her he could write a better ending then the author (no he couldn't, and if that's the case, why couldn't she? and why did they come in the first place?), they decide to go to Anne Frank's house. She's tired of going upstairs because of her lung cancer. When she's at the place where Anne Frank hid, she kisses the boy. Other tourists who were there clap for the blatant disrespect of Anne's suffering because they're Nazis(it's the only reasonable explanation). This clapping cheers them on to having sex.<br><br>At this point me and my girlfriend were discussing going out of the theater before the end, because it was so bad and cliché, but we stayed, just in case the end was amazing to make up for all this bulls...<br><br>They go back to America. Guy has cancer again and becomes depressed (He knew it before going to Europe, but only gets depressed about it now, w t f?!). In his depression he stops talking to girl (because romantic movies need a moment of sad separation which can always be easily resolved after some days by talking). He starts talking to girl again... about death. Girl writes eulogy for boy, and reads it to him. Boy dies, it's time for her to read eulogy (I'm thinking: she's obviously not going to read the same thing again, because that would be boring for the audience of the movie) and then she doesn't read it! (what?! who saw that coming except for everyone!?). She decides to say bland feel good lies in his funeral, instead of the truth, because she's a conformist narcissist coward. <br><br>Girl gets a paper that leg cancer boy wrote to her before he died. I barely remember, but it's some romantic BS. The end.<br><br>There's also a scene I don't remember exactly when in the movie that shows how deep does narcissism goes in the girl: She says that she knows that when she dies, her parents are not going to be able to do anything anymore, shrivel and die, because she's dead. Her parents are like: No, we aren't. Get over yourself.<br><br>Highlight of the movie: Another guy plays violin for a short bit of time.",14 June 2014

16,The fault is the script,The_Film_Cricket,"It is nearly impossible to make a film about terminal illness and not make it heartfelt. The Fault in Our Stars has its heart in the right place but  WOW!  you walk out wishing that someone would shake the dust and clutter and broken fragments off the screenplay so it can flow with more efficiency. Here is a movie that is so busy being profound that the characters feel trapped by plot gimmicks and stale dialogue.<br><br>Based on the bestselling book by John Greene, the movie stars the talented Shailene Woodly as Hazel Grace Lancaster, a teenager with Stage 4 thyroid cancer with metastasis forming in her lungs. She's been living with this disease since she was 13, and now she lugs around an oxygen tank with a nasal cannula. Hazel is distant, a bit surly and more than a little bit cynical about the world. In other words, she's a normal teenager. Her parents force her to attend a cancer survivor support group that is led by an overly emotional group leader who begins each session by unrolling a large rug with a big  and somewhat unnerving  picture of Jesus on it.<br><br>One day in group she meets Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort), a fellow teen who confidently announces that he is suffering from osteosarcoma which has already claimed the lower part of his right leg. He's a nice guy that Hazel meet-cutes when she bumps into him in the hallway. There is little resistance from either side as to how they feel about one another and in the blink of an eye, they fall in love.<br><br>That's more or less all that you need to know. The connection between Hazel and Augustus is not really built on chemistry but on the fact that they both suffer from terminal illness. The movie doesn't have the flow of real life, but is built on conventions of the plot. Everything in their relationship is calculated for effect, we get gimmicks instead of narrative. For example, Augustus carries around a pack of cigarettes and occasionally puts one in his mouth. Hazel is disgusted but Augustus offers this explanation: ""They don't kill you unless you light them. And I've never lit one. It's a metaphor, see: You put the killing thing right between your teeth, but you don't give it the power to do its killing. A metaphor."" That's fine, but the sight of Augustus with the cigarette in his mouth looks as ridiculous as it sounds. He puts the unlit cigarette in his mouth so often that we want to take his away from him and say ""STOP THAT!!"" The movie is loaded with strange moments like that. There is an odd subplot about a book that Hazel has read over and over by a mysterious author named Peter Van Haughton who has apparently disappeared into seclusion somewhere in Amsterdam. After a long and pointless series of arguments with doctors and with Hazel's parent, she and Augustus accept an invitation to fly to Amsterdam to meet him. Van Haughton is played in an angry performance by Willem DeFoe that seems shoe-horned in as if he were visiting from a different movie.<br><br>Worse is what comes next. Hazel and Augustus visit Anne Frank's house. Naturally, Hazel has trouble climbing the series of steep staircases. When she reaches the famous attic, there is little to no attention paid to the fact that they are in Anne Frank's famous hiding place. Instead, the scene climaxes with Hazel and Augustus's first kiss, to which all the strangers around them begin to applaud.<br><br>The movie never really deals with the issue of what it is like to live with cancer, or the inevitability that it will claim your life. The dialogue lightly dances around these issues but no one ever gets serious about discussing them. They know they're going to die but neither Augustus nor Hazel ever get down to the serious business of discussing what lies on the other side. Augustus talks a lot about ""oblivion"", which indicates that he is an atheist, but the movie doesn't go there. We know from the beginning that one or both characters will face the final curtain before the movie is over, but the film's final act is a long  very long  series of slow passages about eulogies and final wishes that goes on and on and on. It should be moving us to tears but you find yourself checking your watch instead.<br><br>Hazel informs us in the beginning that ""Pain deserves to be felt."" We agree, but the movie could do with a lot more pain and a lot less catharsis. The characters talk and talk and talk and talk, but nothing they have to say has any real meaning. Death is the inevitability of this story, but there's such a long and drawn-out funerary tone to the film's third act that is tinged with so much hope and finality that it feels like the happiest sad ending you've ever seen.",7 June 2014
17,"A tad predictable, but very touching/strong performances from Woodley/Elgort.",renschen21,"Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort both have arrows strongly pointing upwards. Both shine brightly in this movie and suck you in from the get- go. Following up their (sibling) pairing in Divergent, they both flash a wide range of chops here. Woodley is charming and smart, and Elgort majorly surprised me showing off a comical side. Also very smart.<br><br>I won't spoil anything, but I did not read the book so I had no/low expectations and was sucked in early on, and definitely was attached to the characters throughout.

18,Sick from cheese,SusanHampson,"This film is horribly cheesy. Hollywood does cancer very very badly. The male lead could not act and therefore I was not convinced and therefore I did not cry. I cry at everything usually but this film is not convincing at all. It was definitely the male lead that spoilt it for me. I just didn't understand his naked obsession with the female lead. From the minute he sets eyes on her, wham he is in love! I found that very strange, or maybe it was just the way he did it. I know love at first sight happens but this seemed way over the top. If you watch Love Story from the 60's which features cancer, it has an authentic love story and build up but this film does not seem to be that genuine so you don't really care about the characters. To be frank, the whole thing reeks of cheese. Stay away.",2 July 2014
19,This movie gave me brain cancer,frankieD56,"OK, so typical sappy romantic BS, but this time they have cancer? Oh give me a break. Yeah, thank god they're wealthy, attractive white people so they could have their little romantic adventure. My cousin got lymphoma at age 16 and could barely eat because of medical bills, his parents are so deep in debt they had to sell their house as no insurance would cover him. But the ""tragedy"" here is that pretentious d-bag Gus (and his cringe worthy pseudo intellectual metaphor) died *after* traveling to Europe and banging a hot girl. Oh the humanity! This is a love story written for the 1%, where the biggest tragedy in life is that spoiled little daddy's money babies Gus and Hazel couldn't live to 90 off their parent's dime, probably in some Malibu beach house.<br><br>If you're a rich white person with no concept of real life, you will enjoy this.

20,The best film I've seen.,robyndolls2859,"Without me blabbering on, I would like to give my complements to John Green and his Team. The Fault In Our Stars is a fantastic book which has a really sad ending (I'm not going to say it to you). As the quote says ""Some Infinities are bigger than others"" however, Hazel and Gus's love was quite an extraordinary one. It must of been hard living with Cancer. The book was different, but it still had the same story to the film but with more parts. I got the book after the film came out so my book has the photos in it. I have to say I did cry at the end but I couldn't stop blabbering through the film. Too be honest, Hazel Grace has inspired me. Not everything in life is perfect and people are dying, this book showed the good and bad sides to cancer. <br><br>Like the book says, pain demands to be felt. It touched my sad side. This book is one of the best. Thank you.",7 July 2014
21,True to the book,pamma09,"I read the book several months ago and have been anxious for the movie. So this grandmother went with her 16 yr old grandson who had also read the book. We are both happy with the adaptation. The story of two teens with cancer who meet in a support group for teens, neither want sympathy and both knowing they will die - want to live life. They exchange books and because of the ending of one and the questions they have - they email the author in Amsterdam. Because he had not used up is 'wish' they end up being able to go there and have the chance to meet the author. Willam Defoe portrays the alcoholic author so well - you do not like him. Gus also tells Hazel something he has been keeping from her. Gus and Hazel have their ups and downs and knowing their time may be limited their love is fresh and true - and presented so well. All the acting is good, the sets, the music -and there is a lot of music but I did not notice most of it - a sign of a good movie score. I volunteer in a hospice facility and it was so good to see the presentation of their cancer as real. Their feelings of what they are going thru as real. I will read the book again and see the movie again - it is worth it.",6 June 2014
22,This is an appalling waste of time,Deborahstenson,"Why does this film have such a high rating? I've been tricked so many times this year by high-ratings and rave reviews to films which have turned out to me absolutely atrocious that I'm losing my faith in film critics and the cinema-going public alike.<br><br>I was promised this film would be a tearjerker, but the only thing that jerked was my gag reflex. I have never met a more obnoxious and irritating character as Augustus Waters and the whole script was painfully cheesy for about 80% of the film.<br><br>I strongly recommend you do not see this movie.<br><br>Ever.<br><br>Even if you are paid to watch it.",25 June 2014
23,A modern masterpiece?  I think not,russell-martin,"Firstly, I must say that I am not a cold hearted person. I love a good weepy film and I was looking forward to a hungover Sunday afternoon cry but instead I was just wanting the film to end. So, what went wrong? I would say that the main reason is that Hazel is just not a likable character. Gus was just about likable but I felt nothing for Hazel, throughout the whole film she seemed cold and distant, something about her just didn't work. I'm not sure if something was lost when it went from book to screen but something happened (or didn't). At 2hrs 6 mins it was just too long..<br><br>KISSING IN ANNE FRANKS HOUSE?! What the f....? And then to be clapped for it? What? I almost cheered Willem Defoe's character for attempting to take Hazel down a peg or two which, I may add, was the only good thing to happen during the abysmal Amsterdam part of the film.<br><br>This just bored me and the only way it almost got any kind of tears out of me was from me mourning the 2 hours of my precious weekend I just wasted on this tripe.<br><br>For those of you who think that this is a modern masterpiece... you really should see a few more films. Even in this Genre alone this film is WAAAAAY down the list of modern masterpieces...",16 November 2014
24,Well-Meaning Tears!,g-bodyl,"To anybody to sees The Fault in Our Stars, male or female, be sure to have a tissue handy. I have seen a countless number of films, and I confess this is the film that may have teared me up the most. This realistic story about two teens with cancer coming together is so sweet, but there is also an emotional weight added to the story because of the subject matter. The film doesn't try to be saccharine, but it tries to be sincere. The movie has a light-hearted tone for the most part, despite the dark subject matter and that I can truly be happy with. <br><br>Josh Boone's film is about two kids named Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters who fall in love with each other when they meet at a cancer support group. Together they go on adventures with nothing to stop them, not even the Grim Reaper. <br><br>The film is truly well-acted. Shailene Woodley deserves an Oscar nomination for this role. Her charisma is inspiring and this may be her best performance to date. Ansel Elgort is not too shabby himself. I loved his quirky personality and despite his problems, still has the ability to keep his witty charm. Nat Wolff was very good as Augustus's friend, who had cancer rob him of his eyesight. Laura Dern turned a sympathetic performance as Hazel's mother and Willem Dafoe gave an hateful, but very good performance as the author who influences Hazel. <br><br>Overall, The Fault in Our Stars is an incredible film. It's a very deep, thought-provoking movie It goes in a lot deeper than a normal romance film would do, and that adds more effect to the film. By the time the end credits rolled, my eyes were dripping with tears and to say that's rare while watching a film is an understatement. A powerful, well- meaning story about cancer-stricken teens falling into such a passionate love. <br><br>My Grade: A+",1 May 2015

Seriously if I had a dollar for every time they said ""Okay"", I would be a damn rich man. The whole idea of the story made me laugh, honestly. Not only was the acting horrid, the music was very boring, and the writing was noting short of a magnum opus. Absolutely freaking horrible. There were a couple scene's where I actually burst into laughter because it was just that stupid. The only people who awed and cried over the film, were a bunch of 13-16 year old teenage ""tumblr"" girls, who nobody can stand by the way, and they were crying and screaming the entire screening. My friend says he'd wish to just kick them out of the theater himself.

I wouldn't suggest this garbage be watched by anyone(unless you are that 8-12 year old girl that find badly written scripts 'good'). You get more content from a Maury 'who's my baby daddy' episode. If you find yourself with nothing to do, avoid this movie! Even as a last resort! It would leave you empty inside from the hollow acting, all the way to the bad script and plot scenes. Should you have a daughter that wishes to see this, prevent that from happening at all costs.

28,The fault in the ratings,prince_c3,"Well, IMDb please, please, please....I trust your ratings so much so that, every time whether its in Cinema hall or on Netflix or anywhere else, even before renting DVD from red box I always check IMDb ratings before deciding whether to watch or not. When I see 8+ rating. I didn't bother to click few pages to read the user reviews seriously my bad, I wish I would have time to read few pages instead of blindly believing the some paid reviews and paid rating by IMDb.My cousins were pulling and honking car horn waiting outside so I just gave in. Lesson learned. I wont trust on IMDb ratings again. Also, I was not furious on my money or my time being wasted like that, but did anyone ever thought giving 8+ ratings would put this movie in the league of Godfather,The Shawshank Redemption,The Lord of the ring series,Good Fellas, Star wars and likes, its utter disrespect and blasphemous for these great movies to put this good for nothing movie and listed and counted among them. People might be thinking or comment that this reviews comes from insensitive person or I don't have heart. Seriously my cousins and I seriously tried to cry but we all end up laughing along with few other fellow like us and also got the wrath of some bull...teenagers who saw this movie as some sacred text like Bible being translate to movie?<br><br>OK, now come to the story our pretty Shailene Woodly got cancer and dying very depressive, but why every time they end up in support group and all the good Christian and the worst of the movie was not her, in fact she save the movie else we all would be out of cinema hall in first 15 minutes, the worst part of the movie was that Chocolate face Ansel Elgort seriously this guy can only be her brother and he should stick to brother's and kind of looks because he is so emotionless even on most emotional scenes. He act like he is acting badly. The cigarette scenes were most terrific. Then comes the author part, seriously! a author of some unknown book are in seclusion and drunkard, he was not John Gresham or Stephen kings or some Pulitzer Prize winner author who hasn't got any good book and now in hiding...Not only that the author has no respect for cancer patients or something like that he was rude, drinking all the time and insult our protagonist. Next comes our 18 years old so called virgin boy had sex where? Well, at Anne Frank memorial and that was highly encouraged by applauding strangers, I mean seriously!!!!How much pain one can bear does this director has any idea? So the worst is not yet over by this time we were so bored but to keep our self busy and in fact start enjoying the comedy, so we start playing games who will die first Elgort or Shailene...so by this time I know so much about script I told them what would going to happen and who will die first and how it ends...surprisingly that's what happen, because the script and screen play was so shallow any 6 years old could predict.<br><br>Please, emotions are set aside and reviews of teenagers are one thing, please IMDb remove the 8+ rating and give it a true 2 or at most 3 star ratings and please stop insulting movies with 8+ rating its offensive.",19 October 2014
29,"The Fault Is Not in Our Stars, But in Ourselves??",naxt1114,"The Fault in Our Stars was good. It was funny and certainly heart gripping. I thought Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort did a great job. Overall the story itself was magnificent, albeit there were several faults in the film itself.<br><br>The editing was awkward at times and there were noticeable contradictory mistakes that I will not dwell on other than to say (without spoiling anything) that there is a teleporting basketball trophy... See if you can spot it!! I also felt that the framing was too narrow at times and some of the two frame shots were unnecessary and distracting. My last and largest problem was that there is a huge difference in what works in a book and what works on film. Some scenes can feel odd  and that is because they are out of place. In addition, the themes could have been much stronger and left us in really thinking. Sadly the film did not quite make it.<br><br>I may be focusing too much on the negatives.

31,Lack of substance,felicia-yap,"Take out cancer and they are left with a hollow storyline. The movie is simply not believable to me. I know it is fiction but fiction can be made into a very believable film if it has relatable characters or storyline. Not to mention, I find Gus' character rather simple- minded. Hazel's parents characteristics are contradictory too. They are portrayed to be protective of their daughter's well-being and safety but this conveniently dissipates when Hazel wanted to fly to Amsterdam with Gus.

Both main characters did a terrible job acting, you can't feel chemistry at all they're just reading lines. Constant staring which is creepy and empty and weird not romantic. Boring.

33,One of the worst movies I have ever seen,anemarifiser,"OK...so I saw this movie...what I think about it?..It was awful...like the summary says: ""one of the worst movies I have ever seen"". The story it's pretty simple...with basic ideas..she's dying...for like 7 years or so..because of course..her parents have money and manage to give her all that she needs. From my point of view it has too much drama.Of course, I spilled some tears but just because it's all about dying in this movie.How can you not cry a little?... The only brilliant thing about this story is that writer who says the things as they are right to her face..the first time they meet because, the second time (at the funeral) he just becomes part of her drama, trying to help her and all of that. I didn't forget about Gus..the boy (of course there is a boy.. her boy). They ""where together"" for a couple of months before they kissed..and that kiss..just gave her her breath back after she climbed all of those stairs..classic..

Hazel is disgusted but Augustus offers this explanation: ""They don't kill you unless you light them. And I've never lit one. It's a metaphor, see: You put the killing thing right between your teeth, but you don't give it the power to do its killing. A metaphor."" That's fine, but the sight of Augustus with the cigarette in his mouth looks as ridiculous as it sounds. He puts the unlit cigarette in his mouth so often that we want to take his away from him and say ""STOP THAT!!"" The movie is loaded with strange moments like that. "" - Bad camera angles, scripting and jarring pace. Normal scenes are given heavy emphasis and over-emphasised. Nothing feels natural, the chemistry seems forced.

37,Movie was okay...crowd was ANNOYING.,dismantlexme,"From what I saw and heard of this movie it was okay. The acting was good, the story somber, but alright, but the distracting crowd ruined any chance I had of developing feelings for the characters or story. Although I ended up having a great time at the movie, it had to do with my reaction to the crowd and not the film. And now, my experience at opening night of the movie The Fault In Our Stars.... I had read some about it, that it was a popular book, and that the movie was going to be sad, but good. Man....was I ever in for a surprise. So I took my male cousin Robin(both of us in our early 30's), telling him that it was a tear jerker, but that I had heard good things. We arrived to a PACKED theatre. Packed with teenage girls. We found 2 seats finally in the middle of a row. Before the movie started the theatre people gave an announcement that after the film there would be a Q&amp;A with the writer and the 2 lead actors via satellite. The crowd of girls screamed and cheered. Then when the films opening credits started, more screams. We both looked at each other and said ""what the heck did we get ourselves into?"" Then once the lead male came on the screen, it was like we were transported to the 60's at a Beatles concert. Seriously, the girl beside my cousin was actually biting down on her sweater, shaking and squealing. Then every 30 seconds we had to hear ""awwwwwwww"" for every cute look or nice thing the boy said to the female lead. Really, we were annoyed because we felt like we couldn't enjoy the film. Then....................SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>When we learn one of the leads is going to die....the whole theatre started crying...collectively blubbering in unison. Then for the remainder of the film the cries turned to heavy sobbing. Girls clutching tissue boxes and their whole bodies convulsing in lamented moans. And my cousin and I just couldn't keep ourselves together. I felt him choking back laughter and then I was choking back laughter and then we just burst out in gut wrenching laughter. WE JUST COULD NOT STOP LAUGHING! <br><br>We tried to make our laugher sound like sobs. People must have thought we were loosing our heads with sadness. But we couldn't help it, it was just TOO FUNNY. We got the heck outta there once the credits rolled. Looking like most of the movie goers...all teary eyed and puffy faces, but our tears were from laughter. I HAVE NEVER LAUGHED SO MUCH AT WHILE WATCHING A SAD MOVIE IN MY LIFE. <br><br>I think if u want to bypass the annoying teenage girls, wait till it comes out on DVD.

40,Hurting So Good (Raging FIlm Reviews),scott johnson,"I was nervous going into The Fault in Our Stars. I really liked the book, although it had been hyped up quite a bit, and I knew that the trailers made the movie look like a cheesy and somewhat ""hip"" adaptation. The movie, however, blew away my doubts and resulted in probably the saddest movie you'll see all year or for quite some time. <br><br>For all of you who haven't read the bestseller, The Fault in Our Stars follows Hazel (Shailene Woodley), a young girl suffering from cancer. She is bitter and snarky about her condition. She does not have any apparent friends (her one friend in the novel was cut from the film), and she feels like she is just a ""grenade"" waiting to go off. Her mom (Laura Dern) urges her to go to the group counseling at the local church. This is where she meets Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort), the boy who will eventually sweep her off her feet.<br><br>From the get-go, it is clear that Woodley shines in her performance. We grow so attached to her by the end of the film. Her performance brings the character from the pages of the book to life. The cancer has made her flawed. Not in the physical sense, but in the fact that she tries to build a shell around her life and is fearful of anybody getting close since she thinks she could die at any time. Her relationship with Augustus is fueled with such great chemistry that you would assume that they were actually a couple. Elgort, who starred with Woodley previously in Divergent is excellent in this as well. He will certainly be making more of a name for himself after this film. Their chemistry helps make the moviewhich could come off as just a sucker-punching tear festinto something where everything happens naturally without making it feel too forced or contrived.<br><br>But sadly, not in a disappointing way, the film is still a tear fest. We know we are being set up for a huge emotional climax. We know that the cancer is forever present. We know we are going to cry; yet we go along for the journey because it feels true. With the movie clocking in at slightly over two hours, I did feel that it was long, but never did I not enjoy the ride. Even having read the book, the events of the movie still hit harder than I expected, resulting in multiple occasions of tear-filled eyes. I cannot say the same for the other people in attendance, though, because I heard several sobs from people behind me, and even some lingered into the credits. The movie is an emotional roller coaster right until the very end, so be prepared.<br><br>The supporting cast supports the main cast admirably. Dern as Hazel's mother is a heartbreaking and real performance. Her character explains that even if Hazel were to die, she would still be a mother, and man do we lose it. Also supporting is Willem Dafoe, in yet another rough and unpleasant character, as well as Nat Wolff from the Naked Brothers Band who plays the star-crossed lovers' friend. Word has already been spread that he will be starring in another John Green adaptation, Paper Towns, so be on the lookout for that.<br><br>In terms of actual filmmaking, there are a couple qualms that need addressing. Near the beginning of the film, the movie appears to be cut together by an editor who lacks any experience at all. I never really address editing in my reviews but there are some exceptionally bad moments in editing and sound editing. Sometimes it feels like the film is turning into an action film with some rather quick cuts that are done just for the sake of getting a different angle.<br><br>In the end, The Fault in Our Stars will leave you in tears. It is an emotional journey along with two kids who have cancer and it reminds us to live life to the fullest and to never let the adverse elements in our lives keep us from living the life we want. We, like the characters, get to choose who or what hurts us. So, if you want to let some emotions out, go let this movie hurt you because it hurts so good.<br><br>for more reviews, check out ragingfilm.com",2 July 2014
41,It's got a high score because the teenage girls all gave it a 10.,Billy Bishop,"Every girl I know was obsessed with the book. And then the movie. I figured that it had to be good, with such a high score. Makes sense, right? Man, was I surprised. The movie was awful. The majority of the actors weren't at all believable and those who were played annoying and cheesy clichés. Many scenes made no sense and were unrealistic. The whole experience was bad as well. The audience that went to see this film is made up of teenage girls who ignored all the faults in the film and gave it a 10. I hope someone like me is reading reviews here. Then maybe they could avoid ever paying to see this movie. I nearly left the theatre towards the end when pretty much everyone in there started sobbing uncontrollably. It was too cheesy and bad to be at all emotional. There was nothing I took away from this film. I wouldn't recommend seeing it. I was extremely disappointed.",6 August 2014
42,"So very disappointing. It seduces teenagers, but what do they know?...",xray-953-237678,"It's a pity. A book like this, one in a decade, from an incredibly talented author, to have this fate! A disastrous film, nothing works. First, the script: Almost always it's different from the book it's based upon, which is not a bad thing, but here, we have a complete misunderstanding from the script writers. Green constructed his story so beautifully, piece by piece with the precision of a clockwork. All of his work went down the drain. I don't want to go into the details of the story, but if you've read the book, just don't see this film. The casting is a joke. Two perfectly healthy young boy and girl, pretend to be suffering from cancer. Not even their make up is believable. Willian Dafoe even worse of his usual bad self. A disaster. The director is a complete failure, in directing actors, as well as picturing interior, or exterior spaces. Last but not least, the music is so bad, it sounds like a cheap - very cheap - TV series selection. Everything in this film is so bad, I wouldn't know which is worse. In total, John Reed's masterpiece should have a better fate being filmed. Of course it seduces teenagers, but what do they know?...",3 September 2014
43,A Sick Pathetic CANCER movie,Abhilash Pillai,I was totally spellbound on seeing an 8.2 rating for this movie.IMDb rating has nowadays become wholly untrustworthy.The whole thing seemed like a soap opera series with crying tears and sentiments.If so much people are giving this rating I believe it is only for the sob.In real life this is really heartbreaking but for a movie it is sick and pathetic.The heroine does not deliver anything and the hero seems worst.The whole movie does not even require a review.It does not do the main basic reason for a film--TO ENTERTAIN(whether for crying or for laugh or for horror or any other emotion.This movie is for immature people who like to cry on seeing rubbish sentiments.....,29 August 2014
44,"Some good acting, insincere, infantile script.",Arjan Timmermans,"I've created an account for the sole cause of writing a review for this film, as I'm stunned by the fact that very few people seem to notice the flimsiness of the script.<br><br>Although this is obviously a teen movie, it starts OK with a good level of irony to balance out the profound underlying subject, not to make it too sentimental. This balance is totally lost after about 45 minutes. Anne Frank comes in out of nowhere, just to stir up the emotions a little more. This (along with some other plot twists) came across so insincere, that I decided to leave the theater half an hour before the film ended.<br><br>The fact that tear jerking seems to be a higher priority than offering solace and a good movie leaves a bad taste in my mouth.",3 July 2014
45,"Great story, but not the book.",Jesse Wojdylo,"I will be the first to say that the book by John Green captivated me. I went to the Chapel Hill Public Library to do some Wojdylo Social Media work and ended up seeing this book on the ""must reads"" shelf right before Christmas. I read the book in about three hours and I knew I had to watch the movie. I went to Twitter and asked my friends their thoughts on the book. They all loved it. I had to wait six months to see the movie.<br><br>I absolutely loved the book and the movie was outstanding. The one thing I did not like about the movie was the fact that Augustus' prior relationship was never mentioned in the movie. This was one of the main parts of the plot of the book as he did not want to hurt someone else. That did not play out at all in the movie.<br><br>Other than that, I felt as if the movie did a great job of telling the story of Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters. There were moments in which there were tears in my eyes and there were moments that I could not help but laugh. I honestly wish I would have read the book closer to the movie release because I forgot some of the amazing lines and the movie did not do them justice. There is just something special about reading that great one liner.<br><br>As with most movie adaptations from books, I would strongly suggest reading the book first. The movie is well above average and even great in my book, no pun intended. Let me know what you thought of the movie!",25 July 2014
46,Sad,Quietb-1,"If you need a good cry, this movie is for you. You know going in you're going to a ""this can't last long"" love story.<br><br>In addition to using every sad trick in the current dying youth arsenal this effort goes beyond and even calls on Anne Frank references in case there is still a dry eye the house.<br><br>Perhaps the movie works too hard and too long to use one more Kleenex. How many ""eulogy"" scenes does one character need? Good thing Hazel or Gus didn't have a dog or it wouldn't have made it through the movie.<br><br>The performances are easier to watch then the subject matter. The young leads will be mentioned in Golden Globe circles. Laura Dern, the second best actor in her family gets better with age. William Dafoe can't be as bad as written. His one sour note performance and implausible popping in as the mail man felt contrived.<br><br>A good score and use of the Amsterdam locations lift spirits.<br><br>Dealing with cancer, the death of a child, and the loss of a friend are tough subjects to explore. Perhaps the movie is actually soft and romantic compared to the truth. After all as Tom Cruise once said, ""you can't handle the truth"".",18 June 2014
47,Tiresome and Too Long Romance,Claudio Carvalho,"The seventeen year-old Hazel Grace (Shailene Woodley) has lung cancer and needs to carry everywhere an oxygen tank. Her mother Frannie (Laura Dern) encourages her to go to a cancer support group against her will. However, when Hazel meets the eighteen year-old Gus (Ansel Elgort), who lost part of one leg with cancer but apparently is cured, they fall in love with each other. Hazel introduces her favorite novel to Gus and tells that she dreamed on having a conversation with the author, Van Houten (Willem Dafoe), who lives in Amsterdam. Gus contacts him and Van Houten invites them to visit him in Amsterdam. They travel to Netherlands with Frannie where Hazel will learn that things are not like they seem to be.<br><br>""The Fault in Our Stars"" is a tiresome and too long romance. The story has a promising beginning, sort of Gus Van Sant's ""Restless"" and supported by the good performances and chemistry of the young lead couple, but the film should have been edited to become shorter. In the end, it becomes a melodramatic Mexican soap opera. My vote is six.<br><br>Title (Brazil): ""A Culpa é das Estrelas"" (""The Fault is from the Stars"")",1 November 2014
48,Circus for the masses,angeluz-1,"I am open minded enough to watch/read a work of art that is not in my typical favorite subject. That's why I watched a film with a 8.2 rating despite that being under the ""romance"" category. <br><br>The dialogs where 100% not teenagers, despite the fact that they may be mature because of their life experience... Have you heard a real teenager speaking? The whole movie is so surrealistic that it would be the same if the characters were blue and could fly. <br><br>And by the way, not less important, the movie is disrespectful to real cancer patients and their families. <br><br>But, if you like to cry for some sick fiction teenagers for entertainment, because you can't feel a s**t in real life, this can be a good pick.",1 September 2014
49,Not Impressed,MeMeTellem,"I used to be a regular visitor of this site because I would check the ratings to decide whether or not I would watch a movie I don't care to see. This movie is rated well above what it deserves. <br><br>It started off nice. I thought it was going to tell a realistic love story. Instead, it gave what it said it wasn't, a fairy tale and a cheesy one at that.<br><br>Once you get over the fact that they both have cancer, it really isn't a good movie. It seems like the fact that they are sick is the only thing carrying this movie. <br><br>Some scenes were really unnecessary, rushed, drawn out and well...boring. <br><br>As the movie went on, I couldn't take it anymore. So, as the lady was trying to help the girl up the ladder, I stopped it and returned it. There wasn't any love chemistry between the two main characters. It's more like they liked each other because of the fact that they are both dying. The chemistry is so forced that it couldn't fool a Disney princess.<br><br>I love romance movies but this was a miss. I was expecting a heart melting story considering all of the hype over this movie. <br><br>On the bright side it reminds me of the movie ""Remember me"" except that was a better movie.",29 November 2014
50,TIL: Adding cancer as a story theme doesn't make your movie any more interesting or any less shallow,Daniel Novak,"The Fault in Our Stars is not much more than a cliché romance movie, but with one main difference - the theme of cancer. The fact that both the protagonists have cancer could have given this otherwise atrociously shallow movie some depth, but it didn't. The cancer theme was poorly handled, and despite dealing with such an important and sensitive issue, the movie doesn't rise to anything more than an unoriginal and cliché chick flick. By using it's cancer theme purely as a vehicle for romance, this movie ends up feeling... wrong. It's offensive.<br><br>See, this movie is essentially like porn for women. The female lead is a girl most girls can identify with, except that she has cancer. The male lead is, as usual with these type of movies, the boy of every girls dreams, except that he has cancer. He's handsome, clever, fit, alpha male etc. Inexplicably, he has eyes only for the female lead (of course) and is a virgin. <br><br>So it's basically just another romance movie. Cancer doesn't give this movie any depth, but it's poor handling of the sensitive theme does make it more offensive. <br><br>Oh, and no, kissing where Anne Frank spent several miserable years doesn't make your movie any better, it's just offensive.<br><br>Normally I wouldn't review this stuff, but this is the most overrated movie on IMDb.",28 August 2016
51,This movie is sappy and overrated.,lilytheresej,"I strongly dislike this movie. The love story physically makes me Ill! I wouldn't recommend it to anyone (unless you are a desperate and sappy teenager) It is based on an extremely unlikely romance between two young teenagers who obviously only like each other because they come from similarly rough backgrounds, and are so desperate to have a relationship that they start seeing the first person they bump into. In all fairness, I did find the acting in this moving (particularly from hazel) quite good. Her pain when gus dies is quite convincing. But unfortunately, good acting in one scene is not enough, and this movie (and book) turned out to be a complete waste of time. Please don't put yourself through the pain of watching it.",1 January 2016
52,We call it LOVE,Amin Ghanbari,"Imagining a day without love has become impossible since I watched this movie. No matter which kind of love we focus on, what really matters is this that an antidote to all poisons and a key for all doors has been summarized into 4 words; LOVE.<br><br>It was a year ago when I started reading John Green's novel, ""The Fault In Our Stars"". I found out from the first pages that at least one guy could finally find a new way to anecdote a romance story and do believe in this fact that this guy could make a revolution in this genre. Actually, as a person who usually writes about different subjects, I had never ever thought about this kind of relationship. A relationship between two teenagers whom both suffer from cancer and in a way are strange. Not only the idea of this story is something pure but also the words which writer's used to communicate better with readers are among the best ones. anyway, accept my apology because we are here not for the book's review but because of the movie's one.<br><br>Like all the reviews I have here on IMDb, screenplay is the first item in which I'm interested to talk to you about it. As you know when you want to make a movie out of a successful novel or story which has acclaimed critical praises without any pictures, you have a hard job to do not only because of this fact that you are not able to change everything you want but also because of this fact that maybe changing words affects reader's mind. Here the writers could've done their job in its best way. Just follow these four simple steps and then you will find out why I'm telling you this. 1-Open The Book 2-Read It 3-Watch The Movie 4-Review The Book , and you feel that you've seen all the things you expected without any deficiencies. That's exactly the reason I know this title as an important movie. Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber have done their best.<br><br>About the casts, I searched, but couldn't find anyone better than Shailene Woodley as Hazel and Ansel Elgort as Gus. We've seen them before in the Divergent but here they show how good they are. Two things would be enough to prove their abilities; The way Ansel Elgort tries to communicate with all audiences and his co star by his body language and without any dialogue and sometimes just by staring into Hazel's eyes which shows that he has overwhelmed by his role and his character and the way Hazel tries to convince you she is in love with Gus. So, they've done their job perfectly. Actually, I've become one of their fans since I watched this movie and their amazing collaboration with each other.<br><br>As a conclusion, I prefer to write about the best scene of the movie, based on my own opinion. I think the scene that Gus asked Hazel to write him a funeral speech and asked her to read it in front of him, while he was alive and was there in his own funeral ceremony, was the best scene. The way they became sad, the way they became happy by reviewing their memories and etc. all together would be enough to convince you how memorable this scene is.<br><br>I think if you are interested in romance movies you should watch this movie. Believe me! it's a good one. <br><br>Best Regards, <br><br>Amin Ghanbari",8 July 2015

Yes I loved it however there were things in the book I think should have been in the movie. That's why I give it a 9 not a 10! Now the reason I'm writing this review, this movie is sad. It promises to be sad just by the decription and the trailer. Looking at the cover tells you that it's going to be romantic. If you do not like these types of movies or you are a heartless bonehead like the guy that gave this heartfelt movie a 1 and wishes he could have given a 0, do not watch this movie. My fiancé put it right, this movie (and book) is The Notebook on steroids! You will cry.You will get mad at the crying because it won't stop.

The acting was the worst i have ever seen the dialogue was horrible and it is unrealistic i mean seriously star wars is more realistic and i'm not the biggest romance movie fan but it is still not good I can deal with it if there is good acting, dialogue and is realistic but it has none of those factors. It is predictable because they try to make it unpredictable but it doesn't work it gets worse and worse they try to be funny but the jokes fall flat. Ansel elgort was the worst actor in this and i just wanted everyone to die in this movie. it is even worse than titanic 2 and that movie was not good it at least had people die that i didn't like this only had one so it is obviously sucks",5 August 2015

62,Shailene Woodley gives phenomenal performance in a solid film,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"This movie took me by surprise. Usually this kind of young adult fare isn't something I go for.. Too watered down and formulaic. And although this one does sometimes stray into pandering melodrama, it's for the most part made with a blunt, matter of fact clarity and heart wrenching realism that needs to be commended. Shailene Woodley has been on the map for a while now, and although she sometimes phones it in in mediocre projects (cough Divergent cough), she has a magnetic star quality and gravitas that pulls you in. She is unbelievable here, playing a hard luck girl in an agonizing situation that no one should have to go through. There are two scenes that she just nails, and raise her performance to award worthy quality. After seeing her in Descendants, White Bird In A Blizzard and now this, I can say she's a new favourite. Ansel Elgort is charming, life affirming as gives excellent work as a fellow cancer patient who falls madly in love with Woodley's character, Hazel Grace. Old pros Laura Dern and Willem Dafoe are superb in supporting roles. At one point Dern say something like "" It's how people have always dealt with pain... You just do it."" This film takes that simple piece of advice and makes its characters make decisions and act accordingly.. Yes what they are going through is horrible, heartbreaking, tragic stuff, but it doesn't cancel out the fact that you are LIVING through it, and can make the choice to do just that: live with whatever time you have, and deal with it as best you can. This is what sets the film apart from a lot of other films of its type.",23 May 2015
63,Surprisingly Heartfelt,Dexter Vane,"I went into this movie expecting a stupid teenager-drama. I haven't read the book and I'm not really a love story type of guy. And although many people may see it as just that, a stupid teenage love story, I was very positively surprised. It was actually cute and funny, and I really enjoyed it. It might still have a few klischeè teenage movie things, and it might try to be all inspirational, but It felt real and heartfelt. I was also positively surprised by the performances, which were nicely and lovingly done. It was sad but at the same time gave you a warm, chummy feeling.

65,You Ought to Forget about Dying and be Glad You're Living,VilyaLorien,"This reviews contains LOTS of spoilers, if you are not wanting the movie to be completely given away, please find a different review. <br><br>Meet Hazel Grace Lancaster, a 17 year old girl with lung cancer. Meet Augustas, Hazel Grace's boyfriend, who also has cancer. The movie isn't exactly slow, it just doesn't pick up until the middle because of the character introductions. When Hazel was diagnosed at the age of thirteen, she was granted one wish, and she used it to go to Disney Land and Epcot Center. Gus, however, saved his wish. Hazel wants to meet the Author of her favourite book, who happens to live in Amsterdam. Well, after a few set backs, Hazel her mom and Gus are on their way to meet this Author. The Author even pays for a very nice dinner date for Hazel and Augustas, where they drink champagne and discuss philosophy. Oh, and fall in love. You see, Hazel is dying and because of this she doesn't want to love anyone extra who will be hurt by her passing. What Gus doesn't tell Hazel, is that he too is dying and that the cancer has spread to the lining of all his major organs, lungs, liver, stomach, etc. then they make out after dinner (or at least mostly do). When they meet the Author he turns out to be a grieving drunk who lost his daughter at the age of eight to leukemia. He tells them about greater and smaller infinities and Swedish Hip Hop. When all dying Hazel wants is the answer to three characters who are left behind when Anna, the main character, dies. Naturally, Hazel and Gus become mad at the Author because they wasted Gus' Wish on the Author and he didn't even grant the Wish: tell them about the characters who were left behind. Disappointed, they tour the Anne Frank house. It has two flights of steep stairs and a ladder, to get to the top, where they lived. Then they return home and resume their everyday lives and continue their fights with cancer. <br><br>Traditional Romeo and Juliet story: he even dies first. <br><br>There are a LOT of factual errors, my sister and I finally just started sitting there counting them all. The Anne Frank house has two steep stair cases and a ladder. Hazel is a very stubborn girl, (in the movie Hazel carries her own tank up both flights of stairs and the ladder, with a little assistance from the Author's Assisant), but in all reality Gus should've carried the O2 tank and passed it over Hazel's shoulder up to the Author's assistant and she carried it the other half of the way. Repeating the process for each case. When Gus is diagnosed with the relapse and he becomes so weak that he is in a wheelchair, he should've also been placed on oxygen because by that point the cancer was in his lungs and he was down to less than 30% capacity. And another thing, Hazel has been on oxygen for a number of months (minimally) and has no indignation from the candela pressing on her cheeks, or dryness around her nose and cheeks from the constant air pressure. And lastly, towards the end, where Hazel and Gus are both weak from the cancer taking over their vital organs, they decide to go out to a park not terribly far, but far enough, from Gus' house. And have one last picnic date. Hazel pushes Gus (theoretically she'd be pushed over 240 lbs. and pulling another 25-30 behind her) over uneven ground, and up a small incline. I would be winded and she barely pauses before they start talking and drinking more champagne. It's never said where an 18 year old and a 17 year old precursor a bottle of very nice champagne from. <br><br>The only redeeming points in the movie are that their older, not your usual 15 year olds. And that they dress up very nicely when doing grown up activities, not overly mature, just enough. And that they actually come across as mature, not whiny little children. <br><br>They think a lot about death and how their going to die before they can do anything in life. But what is keeping any of us live until we're old? And of us could get in our cars today and die a million different ways. There isn't anything different about living life with a terminal illness and dying anyway. I say enjoy today and live for tomorrow. None of are guaranteed a ripe old age. And you don't want to be remembered as then person who only thought about dying and forgot they're living!",30 July 2014
66,Not Worth The Hype.,Jdmaxgaming,"Okay, okay. Before we begin to review this title, let's make it clear that I'm a man. Now, The Fault In Our Stars is a story about a girl name Hazel Grace who has cancer. The movie has a solid ground, and doesn't lose it's main focus. The acting was good, but what shined about the movie was the two main characters roles, they felt very natural as a couple, and when your making a love story it's very good to have natural actors (Unlike Twilight). However, the movie dragged a bit too much, I kept saying to myself ""Okay, when are you going to get to the point?"" But still, this wasn't a big problem once you get to the end. One of the biggest problems were that the director rushed the beginning, already three Minutes through the movie Hazel meets Augustus (Her Boyfriend) than, OH OH! There together, or are they? Wait, yeah there together, Nevermind they broke up. That's how it felt anyway. Also, one thing id like to point out is that the movie is not worth the hype! People are making such a big deal about a movie that from the first place wasn't all that great. Oh, another thing, SPOILER! The way they killed off Augustus was just HORRIBLE! We didn't even get a chance to feel bad for the guy because it was like ""Oh! He died that was unexpected"" Than Hazel crys for about 20 seconds than *Poof* Were at the funeral, than *Poof* were at the End credits. And than you kinda sit there like ""Well, that sucked"" So, anyways. This was my small review, again it's not THAT bad but it can wait until the DVD comes out.",11 June 2014
67,too ugly to keep my interest,sugarfreepeppermint,"My patience is really tested when a romantic film has main characters that are unlikable and ugly. The girl in the film has such a nasty detestable face: what a miserable cow. How on Earth does the guy fall in love with that? Totally incredible. Never mind, the guy is better looking than her, but his looks still don't warrant a main starring role in a movie. Why does Hollywood not hire beautiful people, so that we actually may enjoy watching eye candy as the love story, comedy or drama enfolds?<br><br>The scene in the Anne frank house is ridiculous. Two people with cancer on a holiday 5000 miles away from home, are going to waste their precious time, in a dismal location like that. Let Hollywood remind us for the billionth time about the jews and ww2 and the Nazis - even if it has to be jarred into a romantic film. If the pretentious girl had any inkling of real intellect, and hadn't been nurtured in her sick narcissistic ill natured-ness, she might have actually managed to go out and do something enjoyable and more out of the ordinary, rather than the obligatory US tourist Anne Frank house visit. She's as dumb as the typical sheep who can't think for themselves and simply follow the herd. Yet she goes about thinking she's so above it all. Awful smug wench, she is.<br><br>Avoid this film if you're allergic to ugly people playing leading roles in ""romantic"" films that have no other effect than making you depressed.",29 December 2014
68,Watch it only if you would like to wallow in self pity,Shashank Singh,"----this review may contain spoilers----<br><br>This weekend I had an opportunity to watch one of the most disgusting films cinema has to offer and to believe it earned around $286 million has just left me bewildered. The film is an extremely romanticized version of reality and takes on a cathartic display which was supposed to evoke a few tears but ended up doing the opposite(yes,I had a few laughs there). This film in my view is cancer for young minds which inspires you to hold onto fallen ideals. This film is strictly for those with the 'bleeding heart syndrome' very aptly put by the highly revered 'most watched leading man in television history'.<br><br>The 'metaphor' is strictly a test of your coherence - cigarette in mouth without lighting it up is supposed to be funny or cool or whatever.The film invites ridicule and a certain farcical exuberance could never hurt the creators, but certainly does to the viewers.<br><br>The movie is definitely aspires to be like its idol a paragon of self pity , yeah you guessed it right 'NICHOLAS SPARKS'.(as if one was not enough) <br><br>The only character I liked in the film was that of the author brooding,aloof,misanthropic but ruins it all when he shows up at the funeral with a letter in tow.<br><br>This film has nothing new to offer and is as cheesy as ... well cheese and the fact that this movie will have a bollywood remake .... yeah I saw this coming.<br><br>I would like to believe that I have given you a fairly ingenious outline as to what this movie brings to the fore.",5 September 2014
69,A True Masterpiece ::,Friends United,"This one is the best one I've seen in a long time. <br><br>The movie was based on a novel written by John Green which was a best-seller. The plot of the movie is exceptionally brilliant and extra-ordinary. <br><br>Firstly, I would like to thank the director who directed the movie in a way that totally matched with the writer's thoughts, I believe. Without the eternal connection between the writer &amp; the director, this movie might be a big flop, I don't know! <br><br>Secondly, Shailene Woodley who played the character of Hazel Grace Lancaster, was a perfect match for the character. And Ansel Elgort acted tremendously well in his Augustus Waters role. So the casting for the leading roles are perfect match, I must say.<br><br>Finally, I recommend everyone to watch this movie because it's a true masterpiece.",1 September 2014
70,Shailene Woodley is amazing,Red_Identity,"Not as bad as I expected from the trailer, not as good as I had hoped after seeing the reviews. It's not all that great, but it's not bad either. It's shamelessly, even overly sentimental, totally unsubtle, but hey, it works somewhat most of the time. Probably the biggest reason for this is Shailene Woodley. I remember thinking she was really impressive in The Descendants, even in her limited screen time. Then I saw her in The Spectacular Now, and yes, I became a bigger fan. She's pretty amazing here, an actress completely capable of naturally selling the roles she plays, without making them ever feel artificial or contrived. I wish her a long, very successful career, and when it comes to certain things, she's better than the current it-girl Jennifer Lawrence. Ansel Elgort doesn't fare as well. He has some good scenes, but somehow he just comes across pretty unconvincing.",18 August 2014
71,the fault in the adaptation,Sean H-. (cornflakeboy20),"One of the best things about TFIOS was the voice of Hazel. It put a great, creative spin on an otherwise common disease story. We don't entirely lose it here. It's in the narration, and in her speech. Some of the book's whimsy comes out with cute choices like placing text messages into speech bubbles above the characters' heads in the book's font. But...from the beginning, we lose the Hazel's wry commentary, and the movie treats the kids' diseases as the most pressing issues, rather than their mental grappling with them. When Augustus is introduced, he is practically stalkerish in his attention toward Hazel, which is forgivable only because of his cuteness. From here on in, it's all twee cuteness. Augustus is a wonderful, but impossibly movie-like boyfriend who would probably get on your nerves in real life, and would also probably be hiding a terrible secret. The movie is not as pressing as the book when we go to Amsterdam to meet the author that inspires her. There's very little urgency or conflict. The movie delivers sweetness and young love, and it truly is sweet, but at times it loses the flavor of the book. I will also say the wardrobe and art direction are terrible, and that I'm not sold on Shailene Woodley's star quality. Even though her man has one leg, it still seems he could do better. I'm knocking this movie a lot, but I will recommend. The preview audience seemed to laugh and cry in all the right places.",29 May 2014
72,"In the wake of  Twilight's conservatism, it is a shame that this fascinating material has been given such a risk-averse treatment",Likes_Ninjas90,"What inspired John Green to write his six novels, including ""The Fault in our Stars"", was the suffering he witnessed during his five month stint as a student chaplain in a children's hospital. In an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald he explained how this experience shaped his religious and social views: ""I was enrolled in divinity school and thought I was going to become a minister - I'm Episcopalian - but I was disavowed of that notion pretty quickly while working at the hospital."" One lesson he learned was the joy that could be found in a short life, a central theme of this film adaptation. Green has a double major in English and Religious Studies, which helped to develop and sell the novel. It was on the New York Times bestseller list, so the film treatment was inevitable, particularly at a time when young adult books are servicing teenage girls where Hollywood has failed them.<br><br>I haven't read the novel but from watching the film and learning about Green's background it is clear there are religious metaphors explored in both texts. This adaptation is about Hazel, a teenage girl who was treated for thyroid cancer as a child and now carries an oxygen tank with her everywhere. Due to the weakness in her lungs, she is bored, alone and prepared to die. In a recovery group, she meets a young man named Augustus who lost one of his legs to cancer and they toy with the idea of a relationship together. Through his religious values Green is using both these characters as a metaphor for Christ's suffering. Christ died at thirty-three, a young age, but the Bible suggests his death helped enrich people's lives. Similarly, one of the key lines of the film is ""pain must be felt"", which stresses the importance of understanding one's preparation for death and also remembering people with fondness once they die.<br><br>The title of the story is more ambiguous but also encompasses its own Biblical connotations. The love interest in the film is Augustus, which is a significant name in the Bible. Caesar Augustus, ruler of the Roman Empire, was influential in Christ's birth when he ordered a census be taken for every living person. People had to return to their own towns to be registered, which sent Joseph back to Bethlehem and where Christ would be born. The Star of Bethlehem led people to discover the birth of Christ and later redemptive suffering. Augustus is a Christ-like figure, a star for Hazel, because he helps her discover the beauty in pain by adding love and joy to her life in spite of the inevitability of their deaths. <br><br>An early scene in the film pokes fun at some of these ideas, with the recovery group being organised by a religious man who lays out a mat with a picture of Jesus on it. The scene is funny and cynical because it's easy to scoff at him when seeing what the kids have been through. The first shot of Augustus' titanium leg gives a frightful jolt. It's one of the film's few real moments. Yet these same religious undertones in Green's book must have impressed a lot of people. Green is part of the Episcopal Church, a denomination of Christianity, which would have added to the novel's bankability. Through Twilight Stephenie Meyer transformed conservative religious values into a rich commodity and Mormonism was suddenly cool again. <br><br>In the wake of Twilight's conservatism, it is a shame that this fascinating material has been given such a risk-averse treatment. The director was Josh Boone, whose only other feature was Stuck in Love. His direction lacks creativity and the film suffers from it's over length. The camera-work is largely static and few staging directions have been given to the actors, who are either standing stationary or sitting down. The best choice he makes is planting the camera in tight close-ups on Hazel's face. She's played by Shailene Woodley (The Descendants, Divergent), a gifted young actress who raises the material because of the natural expressions she discovers on her brow. During an early group meeting, she shows her discomfort with Augustus looking at her only through her expressions, no words. Conversely, Boone lets the co-lead Ansel Elgort overact with a theatrical style of acting and such overt niceness that it lessens the believability of his near-perfect character. <br><br>Some of the blame should fall on the source material and the film's screenwriters. Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber wrote The Spectacular Now, but their script is sorely lacking in conflict between the leads. Augustus and Hazel's pleasantries drain the film of any tension. They're better conservationalists than Bella and Edward, discussing the inevitability of oblivion, but the plotting around them is dull and increasingly episodic like book chapters. Too little is also made of the adult characters, with Laura Dern given a terribly underwritten role as Hazel's mother. More conflict could have been generated through the desires of both sets of parents. Twilight was foremost about chastity but hid it well under the vampire genre. This film suffers a similar fate: it is about dying, grief and remembrance but spends considerably more time on whether Hazel and Augustus should date or not and swanning around Amsterdam. It is an injustice to Green's experiences because he saw real suffering, which doesn't translate here nearly as strongly as it should.",28 May 2014
73,Not your banal weepie; far better,Harry T. Yung,"Over the last couple of decades, terminal-disease-at-youthful-romances are dime-a-dozen in the proliferated Korean flick market, escalating audience symptoms from indigestion to constipation. ""The fault in our stars"", you probably have heard, despite the subject matter, is not one of those.<br><br>There is one very interesting quote (the circumstances for which are incidental and omitted here): between the 3 of us, we have 5 legs, 4 eyes and 2.5 pair of lungs. The three people are the protagonists Gus (Ansel Elgort, with a smile that wins all), Hazel (Shailene Woodley) and Gus's delightful sidekick Isaac (Nat Wolff, equally delightful), all cancer patients. Gus had one leg amputated from just above the knee; Hazel for all intents and purposes has a plastic oxygen tube anchored to her nostrils all the time (oxygen supplied by a portable cylinder she drags around); Isaac had lost his left eye at the beginning of the movie and then loses the right in the middle of it. Gus has been free from a relapse for a few years; Hazel's situation is ""stable""; while sacrificing both eyes appeared to have preserved Issac's life. But unfortunately, as we all know, nothing is really certain in the fantastic realm of cancer-land.<br><br>Gus and Hazel meet at a cancer support group and eventually fall in love. This is not something new to the cinematic world so I won't elaborate the details. One thing I want to say is Woodley and Elgort have set a new bar for the meaning of ""chemistry"" in acting together. Separately, they are equally superb. On Hazel's side, another wonderful dimension is in Laura Dern's top-notch portrayal of Hazel's mother Frannie. While this is not a particularly manipulated tearjerker, tear will flow, even more so in the mother-daughter scenes than the lovers' scenes.<br><br>(additional SPOILER warning)<br><br>What makes this movie stand out, however, is the reality and cruelty it does not hold back from depicting. A lot of movies with a similar theme would have as the focal point a ""last wish"" sort of scenario, unabashedly manipulated to give an uplifting conclusion. In ""faults"", Hazel has a dream which Gus and Frannie help to realize  to visit an author named Van Houten (a brilliantly casted Willem Dafoe) in Amsterdam. Hazel, in her sickness, clings to a book by Van Houten about a girl who eventually died of cancer. What Hazel (and Gus also) wants to do is ask Van Houten face-to-face when happened to the rest of the people surrounding the girl after her death. To cut a long story short, the three have a dream-like trip to Amsterdam where the young couple is treated to a romantic dinner by the author before the fateful visit the next day. This is where the movie shines: a rude awakening that all these nice correspondence and gestures are offered only by the author's kind-hearted mate. Van Houten turns out to be an obnoxious, ultra-cynical drunk, to such an extent of extracting from our lovely heroine the only four-letter word that appears in the entire movie.<br><br>All these happen only in the middle of the movie. Ironically, this ""common enemy"" becomes a trigger for the young couple to let go of all their inhibitions and let their love flow. The rest of the movie follows a somewhat familiar trajectory. There is a plot twist which may be unfamiliar to some but I, for one, have seen it elsewhere.<br><br>Doubtless, there will be discussions emerging from the theatre surrounding thing such as what makes Hazel and Gus tick, is Van Houton truly a villain or just a realistic depiction of a normal human being etc etc. But one thing is certain: you would want to see more of Shailene Woodley's movies, the ""Divergent"" series aside.

It did not feel as if the actors had that same emotional bond as in the book, yes they are just actors, but you want to feel that realness. <br><br>The dramatic scenes in the movie were quite great, they really made you feel that traumatic experience as if you could feel the pain. <br><br>Willem Dafoe portrayed Peter Van Houten's character quite well: it was the exact aggressive tone he used in the book.

There were those finer details that should have be incorporated in the movie but unfortunately it is not how we want it but that of the director. <br><br>The ""fake"" funeral scene in the church was the same as that of the book, both performances from Hazel and Isaac was the same emotion as how it was portrayed in the book.

75,No fault in these stars,erik-anderssons94,"""The fault in our stars"" is an amazing love story reminding us that it doesn't always end happily ever after. Bringing a movie out of a book is never an easy task, especially not when it's an amazing book like this. Due to this fact I arrived at the theater with some skepticism and concerns. 20 minutes into the movie those thoughts were completely blown away, replaced with only good ones. My reason? The cast. Apart from the mother, who wasn't the mother I had gotten to know in the book, the cast was impeccable. Shailene Woodley, Ansel Elgort, Nat Wolff, Willem Dafoe(even though I'm not a fan in general) all made this movie into what it is. This combined with a fantastic score, and some absolutely beautiful scenes took this movie to different heights than I was able to predict. Astonishing. Making this movie better than the book was a mission impossible, but they sure made a noble attempt. One last shoutout goes to Shailene Woodley who was able to capture the character I grew so fond of in the book perfectly. I rarely use the word perfection but it certainly fits the bill in this particular scenario. To me Shailene, you are Hazel Grace Lancaster.",29 May 2014

81,Just okay,aldri-feb,"More likely backed-up by best-selling novel from John Green, ""The Fault in Our Stars"" is an honest yet faithful love story which containing some positive messages to inspire teenagers. The plot flows as a good drama should be, thanks to screenwriter Scott Neustadter and Michael H Weber who finely adapt John Green's genius idea into a soulful play and beautiful drama. The script for two central characters, Hazel Grace and Gus are well developed. It really shows how Hazel's feeling to Gus grows as much time they've spent together and how they need each other to live despite their imperfect conditions. Besides that, the movie seems taking advantages from Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort's chemistry who easily makes an adorable couple and put some sweet moments from it. <br><br>Unfortunately, ""The Fault in Our Stars"" isn't without it's faults. The other characters beside Hazel and Gus may only just supplement, seems unimportant and sometimes annoying like Van Houten character who looks stupid with his strange behavior and builds an awkward scene every time he appears. Also the film emphasizes more on meeting true love rather than people's attempt on surviving from cancer that makes it missing some points. Don't expect the drama would be as complex as ""50/50"" or ""Dallas Buyers Club"", because what ""The Fault in Our Stars"" offers is much focus on couple dating and having romantic dinner. ""The Fault in Our Stars"" is an average good and sweet drama supported by lovely performances from it's two impeccable stars.

82,Film Reviews: The Fault In Our Stars/www.nightfilmreviews.com,lucasnochez,"I have never been surrounded by so many teenage girls before until I sat down to watch this film. During an early screening of the alluring teenage film adaptation of John Green's novel The Fault In Our Stars, I was surely the minority of the sexes. To be honest, I don't think I knew exactly how outnumbered I was until the film's tragic scenes unfolded, delivering a current of waterworks and overwhelmingly loud wails of screaming, crying and sniffling, predominantly from female audience members. This early screening of the film was jam-packed, and had me sitting only a row away from the massive screen. If Josh Boone's film adaptation of The Fault In Our Stars taught me anything, it's to never underestimate the power of teenage girls and their ability to pack theaters and show their support for films and books they love.<br><br>The Fault In Our Stars is guilty of possessing a number of faults, but its biggest sin lies in its persistence to aspire to be greater than it actually is. It succeeds when it exposes us to the tragic relationship between its protagonists and the loved ones around them, and fails when it aspires to find new territory of plot and redemption for characters that are already born with unlimited amounts of pathos.<br><br>Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley) is as much a teenage girl as any other living in the United States. Her love of reality television, reading and curiosity of the taboo is just as strong as other girls within America. The only difference: Hazel Grace has terminal cancer. The Fault In Our Stars should be a film about cancer and how it effects the people surrounded by it (think 50/50), but it becomes overwhelming with its fascination to overly glamorize the telling of a tainted love story, therefore becoming a love story about people with cancer (think A Walk To Remember).<br><br>From the beginning, love, life and happiness are overshadowed by impending doom, and that is perhaps the problem with the film. No matter how much you fall in love with Hazel Grace or Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort), their fates are sealed. Green's novel may have been about telling a heart-breaking love story between young teens, but much like Hazel's fascination with her favourite book and the open endedness of a certain literary character, Hazel's happiness is less about coming to terms with death, and more about the continuation of the life of her loved ones. The interactions with the people who will survive and live well beyond Hazel's existence are never given their due diligence on-screen, especially her mother (played delicately by Laura Dern), always being pushed aside by the love story that will ultimately end in unhappiness and tears.<br><br>There is sure to be a reason why Green's novel has becomes such a pop culture sensation. The film is said to be a somewhat loyal adaptation, brimming with very clever metaphors of life and death through dialogue and foreshadowing. It does a masterful job of fetishizing the most average looking parks, backyards and parking lots, and makes great use of its supporting actors. Sadly, the two actors that have the most screen time are the two weakest components of the film. Woodley, who is slowly following in the footsteps of Emma Stone and Jennifer Lawrence, seems to play Hazel Grace less, and herself more. With the exception of her chopping off her hair and having an oxygen tank follow her around everywhere she goes, Woodley only taps the surface of her character Hazel Grace, barely gracing audiences with the brilliance radiating with the promise of such a philosophically pessimistic character.<br><br>Elgort, who comes off as a character who is easy to fall in love with, shows much of his charm and promise as a young actor. Elgort as Waters shimmers with potential, delivering a performance of a person who may be a little too cherry and perfect, given sad circumstances.<br><br>Green had said to gain the inspiration of the novel by working as a student chaplain at a children's hospital. Drawn to the exuberant life of its terminally ill patients, Green is quoted as saying he wanted to write a book about people who were constantly being dehumanized, while showcasing the abundance of humanity in people with a terminal illness. The film does an excellent job of making audiences believe that love is what keeps Hazel and Augustus alive. Love becomes the answer, but only for so long before the inevitability of death at the end of a terminal illness takes hold. There is a point where love exists, and people fade in the film, and although the relationships that held strong are bonded by love, hope of an improbably oblivion becomes the films main concern.<br><br>The Fault In Our Stars can be self-assured as being a quality film made for an audience that would be content with half-assed filmmaking. The production quality and storytelling is top- notch, even if its is constantly emotionally manipulating. The soundtrack is filled with hyper ""emo"" songs, the look and feel of the film is drenched with sadness and all hope is lost with each new, depressing plot twist and turn. Thankfully, its supporting cast of actors supports the majority of the film's life. From Lotte Verbeek, a literary assistant who makes the best out of sad situations and breathes new life to new experiences for the couple, to a saddened and miserable author played wonderfully by Willem Dafoe, to the underused best friend to the couple Isaac (played brilliantly by Nat Wolff), the small, brief appearances by the people in Augustus and Hazel's life are never given enough screen time to show shattering conclusions when sadness strikes.",6 June 2014
83,Amazing film. Worth watching.,Sovannprina Kiet,"The Fault in Our Stars is one of the best movies I have ever seen; the 126 minutes is worthwhile. It is one of the most captivating, most romantic, not to mention incredibly hilarious, as well. I was initially skeptical about what the book had to offer, but I stand corrected. Immediately after finishing the book, I went on to watch the film, and to be completely honest, I was not completely disappointed.<br><br>I was immensely touched by the scenes of this film, how perfectly it has adapted from the book. This movie is by far one of the most realistic films I have watched reflecting upon how life is not what you anticipate it to always be; wishes don't always come true (reference in the film, ""The world is not a wish-granting factory) and each and every single person should live their lives to the fullest (before it is too late). The Fault in Our Stars has broadened my perspective of this world, and of how invaluable life is.<br><br>A sorrowful ending indeed, leaving many of us in tears, but just like 'An Imperial Affliction', John Green did leave to us many mysteries in which we will never be able to find out (that is if John Green is similar to that of Van Houten, which I highly doubt) Although, I had my reasons as to why I only gave this an 8/10. One of the main reasons (which you all may find somewhat trivial) is that the characters in the film were not what I had initially imagined them to be like. Isaac should have been uglier, don't you think? What happened to all the things that were described in the film, like having too big pupils? And leaving out parts which I found somewhat significant, such as Augustus' deceased ex-girlfriend. <br><br>I also wanted more scenes to the time when Gus passed away. If you're going to make this film sad, why not make everyone cry their eyes out? All in all, it was an amazing film, regardless of the issues I may have had with it.",20 November 2015
84,Little infinity,mmaffonso-1,"This is my first review ever. This film drives me to this. Its one of the best movie i have ever watched. i decided to write this review cause the film has impressed me a lot. I prefer drama, not romance. But I decided to give a chance to TFIOS cause some friends advise me to. I have read the book and enjoyed it. first of all i highlight the acting of Shailene and Ansel. Mostly Shailene. they formed a perfect couple. Is dificult to think they don't have a real affair indeed (i think they have or did). Hazel is depressed in the beginning cause she is ill. When Gus told her she is beautiful she doesn't agree because she is depressed. Gus was able to conquer hazel's heart by means of empathy. He asks her what she likes most and worked to realize such desire. I think this is the best way to conquer a person. The scene of the first kiss in Anne Frank house is a reference to the old film ""The Diary of Anne Frank (1959)"". In that film Anne Frank kissed her boyfriend at the attic right before the Nazis arrived. Hazel is not sure about the afterlife but Gus is certain. But i think Gus started to doubt about it. Because of this he decided to attend his funeral eulogy in case he couldn't attend after death. The end of the film ,i think, is a metaphor for Hazel's death. Observe that she closed her eyes at the very end. The scene at the house of Peter van Houtin was difficult to watch. When i watched the film a second time i skipped this scene at all. I think Hazel decided to change the eulogy at the real funeral because she rather to say something more oriented to Gus's parents. After the first encounter with peter van Houtin she realized that a writer is totally different from his work as a writer and stopped to search for answers. Finally i would say i loved this film and recommend for those who want to watch a good story and fall in love with Hazel.",16 October 2015

86,"""The Fault, Dear Brutus, Lies Not In Our Stars, But In Ourselves...""",handsomewarrior,"The infamous quote from Julius Caesar basically translates: ""We make our own fates; the stars don't tell us them."" John Green contradicts Shakespeare with his title ""The Fault in Our Stars""; he's saying that children diagnosed with cancer, like Hazel and Augustus in the movie, have their fates written in the stars. The title itself demonstrates how intelligent and deep the movie is. Before watching this movie, I didn't know what to think. I was really expecting it to be just another average romance, and I hadn't even known that it was a tragedy. Hazel's opening monologue made it clear that it was, and my expectations immediately changed.<br><br>Somehow I've been able to enjoy both the Divergent series and The Fault In Our Stars, despite my dislike for Shailene Woodley. One reason I didn't like her in Divergent is because she was the wrong actress to portray Beatrice Pryor, and I didn't like the character presented in the movie anyway. I can't say for sure whether or not Shailene Woodley was the right choice for Hazel in this movie, but at least she did her best.<br><br>The beginning of the movie starts out a little clichéd and uninteresting. Hazel Grace Lancaster goes to a cancer support group, after being forced to by her parents. The support group is at a church, ""literally In the Heart of Jesus"". The first day is just as bad as she expected. The leader is a complete weirdo, and she's not interested in making friends with any of the other cancer victims. The second day, before even entering the room...she bumps into Augustus Waters, and they both are immediately interested in each other, just like in any every other romance movie. She fixes her hair in the restroom mirror before going into the meeting room, and when the group sits down, all Augustus can do is stare at her. She tries to avoid looking back at him, but it's obvious that she's enjoying the attention she rarely gets. Obviously they become friends, he invites her over, and they borrow each other's books. An Imperial Affliction, a novel about a cancer patient, is the book she gives him, and I don't remember the book that he gave her; it's an irrelevant detail. I don't know what she thinks about his book; I don't recall it ever being mentioned, but after he reads An Imperial Affliction, it's all the two of them can talk about. She has sent the author numerous fan letters, but none of them have been answered. Augustus surprises her by reaching Van Houten's personal assistant, and reads her the letter over phone. Of course, as soon as she can she emails the assistant, and the next thing you know they've been invited to meet him in Amsterdam. After a few complications, they finally get to go to Amsterdam, and they eat out and have a great time at a fancy restaurant. Gus tries to pay for the meal, but the waiter declines. ""Your meal has been paid for by Mr. Van Houten."" The next day they visit Van Houten (Willem Dafoe), and the visit is quite disappointing. I'm not sure why, I quite enjoyed the (was it Swedish?) hip hop.<br><br>The movie turns out to be surprisingly good and meaningful. The dialogue and writing are a couple of the stronger points of movie, and they help a lot in delivering the message. Some of the movie presented dialogue so deep, so trivial, so meaningful, so powerful you can't help thinking about it for days on end. The Fault in Our Stars is an excellent example of a tragedy at its best.<br><br>My Official Score: 83/100",18 September 2015

I however had no idea whatsoever what it was about or anything.<br><br>I absolutely loved it. I'm a pretty emotional person and this hit me hard. I was sobbing away along with everyone else in the cinema.. It really isn't a film I would normally go see but i'm glad i did because it was very touching. What a beautiful film, even from a male's point of view. It really was one of my favourite films ofthe year, one of my all time favourites actually. I actually bought it when it came out on DVD to watch again at some point. <br><br>Brilliant.",31 August 2015
88,An amazing story,jody7177,"This film is a love story about two teenagers with cancer, however the film may be about cancer there is so much more than just cancer. It's about two teenagers who who meet each other though a support group and except that they have to deal with their illnesses. This film is filled with all sorts of emotions from happiness, and laughter to anger and sadness. It has amazing actors and actresses in the film and you feel like you actually connect with the characters and feel their emotions. It is an amazingly powerful story that's full of surprises. It's not your every day love story, it's a story that will stay with you forever and leave your mind wondering after the film has finished. However I would really recommend reading the film first, firstly it may help you to understand the film and secondly the book contains more of the story and more characters. Overall it is an amazing film and book that is definitely worth a watch.",27 August 2015
89,Enchanting and a must watch,preetjee313,"Well, lets begin with a line from the movie (believe me, this one's full of 'em) ""If you want the rainbow,you have got to deal with the rain."" The movie is a very soothing journey as you travel beside Hazel Grace the protagonist of the movie and you get to see lives of few teenagers struck by cancer. The plot is sad on the whole but this very fact delivers the enchanting touch to the viewers. It is very well directed and story is really touching; I haven't read the book but having seen the movie I'm sure the book shall be awesome too. In terms of story content the movie doesn't offer much as I can possibly sum it up in a few sentences (don't worry I won't do that) but this is certainly the type of movie one doesn't watch for the story, you watch it for its sheer beauty and emotions. Woodley and Elgort appear as a great adorable couple, interestingly both of them are quite different but still incomplete and they fell in love because they in a sense complete each other and also teach each other and the audience great lessons about life. They show us that in spite of all difficulties and pain we endure there are always people who love us unconditionally and will always remember us no matter what happens and it is our duty to pause and enjoys those really great moments with them rather than yearning for public recognition. This is aptly reflected when Augustus mention that,""Hazel was not widely loved but she was deeply loved"" and I guess that is what is important for all of us to understand. You see her favorite writer flooded with letters symbolizing fame and wide respect, love but is in constant misery and not at all in peace but his work has motivates many like Hazel. So, what is the point of all this fame when is doesn't bring peace to you.<br><br>The movie is filled with exquisite sequences portraying Hazel and Augustus as a very adorable couple, their date in Amsterdam is particularly well shown where the actors aptly exhibit the excitement as well as anxiety of a first date.Well, I'll end this citing another dialogue, this time from Augustus, ""There's a thing about pain, it demands to be felt.""",24 August 2015
90,"A Perfect, Witty, Honest, Sad and Unforgettable Story",Bob Rutzel,"Hazel (Woodley) has cancer and can die at any moment when her lungs fill with water. August (Elgort) has cancer, is in remission, but.. Both meet at a Cancer Support Group and August falls instantly in love with Hazel. We do too. (you're too easy)<br><br>I cannot say enough good things about this movie. It is perfect, witty, honest and will be hard to forget. It's almost like a true story, but it's not. However we will (read should) be reminded of it when we encounter someone with cancer. They struggle with things we take for granted. Things like breathing. See? Keep in mind that although we see stories for our entertainment, real dangerous things have happened to people with medical issues and we should always be aware of that. <br><br>The movie pulls us in instantly as August goes flirting with Hazel and the banter between them is pure gold and it also pure gold the rest of the way. We hope August is a good guy, sincere, and level headed because we like Hazel and don't want to see her hurt. When Hazel is sad, we are sad and when she cries.. August never disappoints. <br><br>Shailene Woodley deserves an Oscar for Best Actress and Ansel Elgort for Best Supporting Actor. Whoever cast them for this movie is a genius. They were great together with a chemistry not often found in movies. Their love will touch us for the entire movie and maybe beyond. <br><br>August finds a way to get Hazel to Amsterdam to meet her favorite author Peter Van Houten (Willem Dafoe) as she needs to know the answers to some things in his novel. Dafoe does good in this curmudgeon role.<br><br>Go to the cupboard or store and get a box of Kleenex because you will need it at times.

However, there is one and you'll be reaching for that box when you see it. <br><br>Notables: Laura Dern as Hazel's mother and Sam Trammell as Michael, Hazel's father. Both are truly supportive of Hazel and also of August.<br><br>We all are subjected to the fault in our Stars (read dreams) and this fault can never be corrected. That is the saddest part of life.

91,"'Okay?'  'Okay.' Perhaps, 'okay' will be our 'always.'",gradyharp,"Based on John Green's immensely popular novel by the same name, adapted for the screen with extreme skill by Scott Neustader and Michael H. Weber, and directed with sensitivity and taste by Josh Boone THE FAULT IN OUR STARS steps so far beyond expectations that it may just be another Nicholas Sparks young adults tearjerkers and actually becomes one of the more impressive dialogues about death and dying and the meaning and importance of love. Add to that a cast of young actors (an experienced actors) who 'live' their roles and the result is a film that should be experienced by everyone.<br><br>Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley) and Augustus (Ansel Elgort) are two teenagers who share an acerbic wit, a disdain for the conventional, and a love that sweeps them on a journey. Their relationship is all the more miraculous, given that Hazel's other constant companion is an oxygen tank, Gus jokes about his prosthetic leg, and they meet and fall in love at a cancer support group. Add to that the presence of Gus' best friend Isaac (Nat Wolff) who also has cancer which makes him lose his eyes (and his mental stability at times) and we have a trio of youth facing enormous odds who end up discovering the real meaning of being alive in the world and the importance of love. Hazel's parents are (for once in film) sincerely supportive in the face of a dying child and realistically portrayed by the brilliant Laura Dern and Sam Trammel. Hazel and Gus travel to Amsterdam to visit Hazel's favorite novelist Van Houten (Willem Dafoe) and discover he is a smarmy drunk who lives with the compassionate Lidewij (Lotte Verbeek). Sharing how the story plays out would involve spoilers for those who have not read the book.<br><br>The on screen chemistry between Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgot sends this film into that rarefied realm of becoming a classic. But for this viewer, even more important is the lesson it offers about the process and concept and meaning and insignificance of death as an ending: it is a continuation.",25 July 2015
92,Excellent entity,lordobscureplus,"Last summer, when my friend bought the book for his sister, I judged it by its cover. I thought it was yet an other ""Notebook"" but I was wrong. This summer, I somehow I ended up downloading the movie because the title suited me. Having started the movie, I realized it was that last summer book's movie. Even so, I felt like I should go on with it, and so I did to see how it'll turn out. I can only say I'm ashamed of my passed judgment based on arrogance and ignorance.""The Fault in Our Stars"" is one of the things in life that's intensely beautiful enough to move me. What I admire most about this story is it being so realistic. You don't see cheesy idealistic events or plans going on through the plot. For instance, when Hazel's on the stairs, she doesn't play the typical damsel in distress, she gathers herself and believes she can do it. (Spoiler) Van Houten is considered to be Hazel's fascination subject due to his work. She loves his work and automatically loves the author as well. (Huge Spoiler) When she meets him in person, she learns he's not as idealistic as she thought he was (or equally idealistic as his work). (Spoiler) I like Gus's quote, ""You're a shitty person, but a good writer."" All in all, I appreciate this movie very much.",23 July 2015
93,It's a very sad romantic story.....,Irishmoviereviewer,"Before I saw this movie, I had a feeling the guy Gus dies in the end. I didn't know how he died but I just knew well that this film won't have a happy ending.<br><br>I thought Gus and Hazel were so cute together like they couldn't get their hands off each other! It's so sad how cancer just kills you silently and loses a loved one that you have been with for so long. I was gutted that Gus passed away and I was thinking at the end of the film that Hazel could've died too when she was looking at the stars lying on a field. <br><br>This movie is really good but if you have a softie personality, then I suggest you get ten tissue boxes lol!",19 July 2015
94,Full of Life Despite Being About Cancer Patients,Rob Starzec,"After reading the novel for a summer class (the same reason I watched the movie) I was fairly surprised at the movie's fast pace, its good cinematography, and that each character was written to be as accurate to their representation in the novel as possible (besides Hazel's Dad, I was promised a crying Dad, not a perfectly secure Dad). However, I am not going to compare the movie to the novel now as I will mostly be doing that for the class since the class focuses on adaptation.<br><br>The casting for Hazel (Grace) Lancaster is near perfect in my opinion even though I had not heard of the actress before viewing the film. Shailene Woodley taps into the lead character's mind with great skill, able to depict Hazel's personality filled with sass and sarcasm as well as being able to cry on many occasions within the film without exaggerating how sad the character is supposed to be, which is usually how actors handle crying: it either doesn't happen at all, or it happens with ridiculous intensity. Woodley is able to be more subtle, handling the character near perfection. All other actors give mediocre performances, including Laura Dern (who I have never loved as an actress anyway). I wanted to like Willem Dafoe's character, but his performance seemed as though it was heavily directed and did not require any creativity from Dafoe himself.<br><br>To lift the mood and ignore we are focusing on dying teenagers in this movie, it is surprisingly funny at certain points, such as when Augustus nonchalantly gives his near-blind friend Isaac permission to break his basketball trophies while maintaining a serious conversation with Hazel - his love interest, which no moment of the film lets us forget.<br><br>For me, moments of this film are extremely cheesy or do not explain things well. Some terms relating to cancer which average viewers would not understand are used once or twice in the film with little explanation, and the dialogue is trying way too hard to be teenager dialogue. ""Listen douchepants,"" sassy comebacks, and corny statements like ""Okay will be our always"" (you probably won't understand this one out of context) are abundant in this film, exaggerating how ridiculous teenagers are or even giving them too much intelligence at times - especially Gus.<br><br>This movie was surprisingly entertaining to me, and I have to admit it is a ""chick flick"" which I would actually watch again without cringing in disappointment. You may not be able to handle yourself as well as I did for this story, so maybe have some tissue in the room if you're going to watch this one.",23 June 2015
95,Life Changing Movie!,thebeautifulmind,"The Fault In Our Stars is one of the greatest movie made of this genre in a long long time.This movie taught me much more than what 19 years of my life could.And when i would tell you what this movie taught me most people would say that they already knew that but there is a difference between knowing something and believing in something.<br><br>It taught me that not every infinite is equal and that some infinities are simply bigger than others.You don't get to choose how big infinite or life you get but you do get to choose how you spent it.And i think its better to live less years with no regrets than live more years full of regrets.<br><br>Second thing that it taught me that you don't get to choose to get hurt in this world or not but you do get to choose who hurt you.If someone you love hurts you than that feeling of pain is a blessing in disguise and the intensity of that feeling of pain could only be told by someone who don't get to feel a thing and what he could give to just felt for once the pain of getting hurt by loved ones.<br><br>The last but not the least is that this movie taught me how to deal with the biggest fear of my live ""Oblivion"".And that the Oblivion is inevitable and only thing you could do is ignore it.And its not about being widely loved or widely remembered but about being deeply loved and deeply remembered,because it is better that people remember you for who you were rather than what you do!",29 March 2015
96,Treads a fine line so that it really works,rogerdarlington,"This could so easily have gone wrong: a story about two teenagers facing life- threatening cancer risks being overly-sentimental but, while being a real tear-jerker, this treads the fine line with skill and warmth. Hazel has thyroid lesions which have metastasised to her lungs and throughout the film wears a breathing tube and lugs around a portable oxygen tank. Gus has n osteosarcoma condition which has stabilised after the amputation of one leg. They meet at a support group for youngsters experiencing cancer and her favourite novel, ""An Imperial Affliction"", takes them to Amsterdam where nothing goes as they expect.<br><br>Since the movie is based on a best-selling young adult novel by John Green, it will find a ready audience in spite of its serious subject, but those who don't know the novel (like me) will find this an impressive and moving work because of the fine acting by the two leads - Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort, both of whom star in the ""Divergent"" series - and the assured direction by young Josh Boone. Of course, it is easy to be cynical about a film like this, dismissing it as mere manipulation, but ultimately all cinema, indeed all art, is manipulative and this is not a self-pitying, rather a life-affirming, tale.<br><br>Footnote: The title of the novel and the film comes from Shakespeare's ""Julius Caeser"" when Cassius declares: ""The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars but in ourselves, that we are underlings"". For Hazel and Gus, their cancer is in the stars but their response to such tragedy is ultimately in themselves.",21 June 2014
97,Exclusive Screening Was Brilliant,Madison Maciejewski,"Josh Boone did an incredible job of bringing one of John Green's best books to life. Very few main parts were left out. After the screening, Josh and John were present for a Q&amp;A and explained that parts that were left out were indeed filmed, just not included. They did this to cut down on run time as well as exclude parts that did not directly pertain to the advancement of Augustus's and Hazel's love story. One part that they did cut was John's cameo (the cannula scene) which is to be included along with all other cut parts in the BluRay edition of TFiOS. My dad, who has not read the book and is not a romance guy loved it!

Or that i do not respect or/and admire people who have or had cancer, it's just that the entire movie fell in a cliché, EVERYTHING. I know that is hard topic, but let's face it,when a film about cancer is in the billboards everybody thinks is a excellent movie when the big C is present in the synopsis. Hollywood had banalized and trivialized the topic, there is a movie almost every year about it, that the people just adore 'em. The industry must look for other ways to show to the common people how hard is the whole topic; The avant- garde films about the topic are not as recognized as they would be (La guerre est déclaréé, or maybe even 50/50 that took the whole drama of the illness with a grown-up patient). It's well done movie, and the end is fresh (yeah, I like the end) but it's still a Hollywood movie made for the teenagers (specially females, really SPECIALLY) who wants to see how love works and then dream about it until they're 30 and they are still singles.",6 June 2014

""Hazel"" does have doubts about falling in love because of her terminal health condition stating she's a ""Ticking Time-Bomb"" but gives in to ""Gus"" who really goes hard for her.

The acting was really good, but unlike every other viewer, this movie did not touch me as it did others. It was not sad until the end, but it still did not rock me or make me cry. I did not think it was an incredibly depressing film, but it also did not pull me in as much as I thought it would.

102,This movie is worth all the hype it is creating and is already my favorite romantic movie.,Kelly Cutrone,"Note: If you think this is another chick-flick, a stupid perverted Rom- com or a depressing story about cancer, ATTENTION: IT ISN'T.<br><br>Being a true fan of John Green's 'The Fault', I was looking forward to its movie adaptation with great anticipation. And this movie is just spot on. Josh Boone was successful to bring out the essence of the book on the big screen in the right manner. The actors portraying the characters were utterly perfect and had a great understanding about their roles. I'll start by talking about the rising enigma i.e. Shailene Woodley (known for her lead role in ""Divergent""). She plays the terminally-ill Hazel Grace like no one else could have &amp; makes me see Hazel in a new light. I greatly appreciate the qualities Hazel possesses of empathy, kindness, wit and no-nonsense attitude. I laughed with her, I cried with her &amp; most of all, I understood her. That is what a protagonist is supposed to make you feel like and she did her job well. <br><br>""The world is not a wish-granting factory."" Now, my favorite character i.e. Augustus Waters, who is portrayed by the new and talented actor Ansel Elgort (seen in ""Carrie"" and ""Divergent""). I am just biased when it comes to him. First of all, I am irrevocably in love with Augustus Waters; secondly, Ansel is just so cute and charming like a peacock in this role..that I cannot even describe it to the best of my capabilities. He's just adorable. *Sigh* He came in Hazel's life and changed it forever, likewise he changed mine too.<br><br>So I was talking about Ansel/Gus. He did his role of a pretentious ,dramatic ,metaphor-believing witty, and funny Augustus with utmost perfection. But when it came to cute, vulnerable, loving, caring , and emotional Augustus, he broke all the dams that were holding my tears back. I literally cried. I won't give any spoilers though. Those who have read the book know what I am talking about and those who haven't should a) READ IT! What are you waiting for? It's a thin book with a roller coaster of emotions. &amp; b) after reading the book, watch the movie! Because this is among the best book adaptations ever.<br><br>Then the cute/blind best friend Isaac is played by Natt Wolff. He is a great comic-relief in this movie. I loved how naturally he said all his lines like a normal person does, but I wish he had more scenes just like in the book. He was great though.&amp; so was Hazel's mom, played by Laura Dern .She reminded me of my own mom. Hazel's father, Patrick from support-group &amp; last and the least (pun intended) Peter van Houten were all like a fragmentation of my imagination put into reality.<br><br>Thank you John Green for bestowing the world with your acerbic wit in the form of Fault and thank you Josh Boone for making it SO perfect. In a nutshell, this movie is worth every smile, every tear, every laugh. Watch it with your bffs or alone and have the time of your life. Okay? Okay.<br><br>This movie is worth all the hype it is creating and is already my favorite romantic movie. I'll rate it with: *****",14 July 2014
103,Definitely Recommend.,jordant10-39-28332,"The Fault in Our Stars is amazing. I read the book long before watching the movie and had extremely high expectations. I almost didn't want to go and see it because i didn't want it to be ruined for me. But I did go and see it and wow. I don't even know how to explain it. It was perfect. The acting was spot on. Shailene and Ansel portrayed Hazel and Augustus perfectly. The storyline was followed. And the quotes were there. Yes. One of the characters from the book wasn't in the movie, Hazels friend Kaitlyn, but even without her (i didn't like her much anyway, just my opinion) the movie was fantastic. John Green wrote an amazing book and the movie version was amazing too. I cried. I laughed. I awhed. But mostly cried. I definitely recommend this movie to everyone. I also recommend the book. Im not much of a reader myself but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The movie brought it to life. You will instantly fall in love with Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters.",28 June 2014
104,Understanding The Faults,Mek Torres,"The Fault in Our Stars is based on a YA novel that somehow becomes a sensation. It's basically one of those which defines the generation's admiration to literature and music, and it majestically expresses them quite sincerely. The movie gives a perfect vision to their blissful moments as a youth. But it's also an uplifting drama about the risks of having cancer and it might be a difficult thing to balance between the sad parts and their happiness, and fortunately it doesn't become a problem. It's not as completely powerful as it should be, but it's wise enough to just embrace its aesthetics and soul.<br><br>It's actually not an original thing to see a love story about two sick people trying to gloss over their pain with a relationship. Hazel and Gus's interaction keeps it simple, attempting to forget the real problems of their condition. These types of drama tend to over sentimentalizing the unpleasant truth behind the person in every single moment, but instead, they most of the time just express who they are. The painful moments only happens when it has to remind the two that they are still living with a fatal disease. The film remarkably hits the right note in both elements. The romance is distinctly endearing, the truly soulful moments that aren't meant to be taken away. And the crucial parts which straightly display the reality of what they are going through.<br><br>They are definitely affecting, but only at the fine level. The real impact only comes occasionally, and when it goes there, it becomes triumphant. The film just needed a lot more contemplation at the rest of the depression. It's probably too busy focusing at the sweet stuff, but that couldn't be a big flaw anyway. The movie just could have suggested to be tougher. Still, I'm glad it manages to flesh out these characters beyond their struggles. The leading cast shines all around. Shailene Woodley is pretty natural as she imbues the character's personality more than just the angsty feelings. It works in both ways but we get to know Hazel better at the brighter side. Ansel Elgort shares the same feat by showing off his charms, until the performance becomes a nuance when the situation has got a lot serious.<br><br>The Fault in Our Stars has favored enough for the fans by being a really good and faithful adaptation of the popular book, but a better movie would deeply contemplated more on the serious stuff. Nevertheless the film still keeps the themes effective; the characters are wonderfully developed and the drama doesn't rely too much on making the audience cry. Overall it's a pretty strong film which standout by its outstanding performances and a direction that fully understands the environment and subtext of every scene, unlike most YA films. And I guess that is what everybody needed for this adaptation.",8 June 2014
105,A dry-eyed tear jerker for this viewer; nary a tear was shed and that truly is sad.,george.schmidt,"THE FAULT IN OUR STARS (2014) **1/2 Shailene Woodley, Ansel Elgort, Nat Wolff, Laura Dern, Sam Trammell, Willem Dafoe, Lotte Verbeek, Mike Birbiglia. Woodley and Elgort star as teenagers with cancer who meet in a support group, make friends fast and fall in love in this somewhat predictable and flat-footed adaptation based on the best-selling novel by John Green (surprising since the writing team of Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber has usually yielded far-better results in past productions) and clumsily directed by Josh Boone. Admittedly I have not read the source material yet having said that this film in no way makes me eager to seek it out as a 'must read sensation' no thanks to some pretentious, teeth-grinding dialogue and Elgort's way-too-look-on-the-brightside-smug/jerky Romeo to the otherwise well-portrayed Woodley's Juliet. A dry-eyed tear jerker for this viewer; nary a tear was shed and that truly is sad.",8 June 2014
106,The Fault in Our Stars was a touching teen drama about a young couple with cancer,tavm,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. We both were touched by the story of a couple of young adults, Hazel (Shailene Woodley) and Gus (Ansel Elgort), both of whom have cancer, and their eventual love affair. One thing they bonded over was a novel about another character with their disease which got them to take a trip to Holland to meet the book's author, Van Houten (Willem Dafoe). I'll stop there and just say there's plenty of touching moments between the couple but also some funny scenes and lines to offset some of the sadness. I also liked Laura Dern as Hazel's mother and Gus' friend Isaac (Nat Wolff). Really, both me and my friend enjoyed this enough so on that note, I highly recommend The Fault in Our Stars.",6 June 2014
107,Much More Than Okay!,hugorocksmy,"This was certainly one of my most anticipated movies of the year, simply because I had read the novel and I really liked it. Therefore my expectations were extremely high, and that is always a problem because for most of the times I end up being disappointed to some degree. And so, I did expect something a little bit different, in terms of emotion but the movie was extremely similar to the novel aside from a few changes. Still, I never got to reach that moment were I felt that this was an adaptation of the book I really loved and enjoyed in many levels. It was something I was hoping for, and it never delivered, except for a few crucial scenes. Moreover, the acting was excellent, Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort were spectacular and were the perfect choice for the characters of Hazel and Augustus. But the movie was Shailene's, she owned every scene and was great once again. While Ansel, he was great too in the way he acted and how he expressed himself and his mannerisms, but I didn't like his physical appearance for the character, to me he wasn't Augustus in the outside but only in the inside. But overall they had a very beautiful chemistry and it showed. Also Laura Dern was excellent too. The movie looked very beautiful, the cinematography gave another sense to the whole movie by not looking like another teen love story about cancer, but a real love story about real people. Furthermore, the ending was something that I knew was coming and that would give me chills, and it was everything I knew it would be. It was extremely emotional and just perfect. Therefore, this was a very good movie, that even though was just like the book, to me it lacked some of the pathos that really made the book very special, but maybe that was just because I knew it was coming. But still, its a very beautiful romantic movie that should please many fans of the book and also those who haven't, that will end up falling in love with Hazel and Augustus. ~June 5, 2014~",6 June 2014
108,Young Love in Numbered Days,3xHCCH,"I read the book by John Green in one morning. It was a quick read, but it was uncomfortable to read in its sadness. This novel was about the love story between two cancer-stricken teenagers. I am surprised it was a bestseller given the book's topic seemed so morose and upsetting for the young adults that it targets. While it had its effective moments, the book had a language that tended to be rather indulgent and unrealistic given the age of its teen protagonists.<br><br>The film is a very faithful adaptation of its source novel. It is so faithful that the faults of the book also become its faults. The film is two hours and ten minutes long. It felt too long, sometimes wallowing too much in its own misery. Luckily, the dialog in the film's script were more believably teenage. I enjoyed the delightful animation used to show us the text messages between the two lovers. The wonderful soundtrack consisted of cool songs by Ed Sheeran and several other indie-type musicians. This type of music highly complemented the film's youthful angst.<br><br>Also, the film benefits from the earnest performances from its main cast. Shailene Woodley has a malleable face, not too perfectly pretty or distinct, just right for portraying a wide array of characters. She was really very effective as Hazel Grace, given that this was such a difficult part to play, demanding both physically and emotionally. Ansel Elgort had the charisma required to play her ideal boyfriend, Augustus. The unbelievable perfection of his character as written becomes his limitation as actor. <br><br>Ironically, for me the best parts of the book did not materialize that well on screen. These were their Dutch-motif picnic in the park and their heart-to-heart talk about the new PET scan result. The way Ansel Elgort delivered his lines in these two important scenes were not clear enough to create the welling dramatic impact they did in the book. The script did not even include that highly-emotional moment towards the end when there was dead silence after a recording of a beloved voice invited to leave a voice mail.<br><br>Overall, I think this film is good to watch depending on your mood. It can give you a good cry if you let it, though I thought the book might be more effective a tearjerker than the film. The best thing about this film is seeing Woodley and Elgort together as Hazel and Gus. The both of them had captured so well the essential chemistry of these two star- crossed lovers as described in the book, and this saves the film from being too depressing.",5 June 2014
109,I don't really get why people love this movie so much,Jack Munson,"It was a typical teen romance drama. It had it's good moments, but there were very few. For the most part the movie just contained sappy and awkward moments. It felt like the movie was trying to make you cry instead of having it happen naturally.<br><br>The characters were very weak and mostly stayed with the same motives and barely changed as people. Since their characters never really changed it made the story predictable. Just see how their characters act and feel and you can see all the clichés and how the story will proceed.<br><br>The acting wasn't that great either. I have seen both of these actors in other movies where they were much more believable. Shailene Woodley was great in White Bird in a Blizzard and The Spectacular Now. Ansel Elgort wasn't the best actor along Shailene Woodley either, she overshadowed him, which didn't make for good chemistry.<br><br>To me the only redeeming part was the soundtrack, which was mostly indie music which fit the mood most of the time.<br><br>The Fault in Our Stars is a generic teen romance movie. Nothing new comes out of this movie. The little redeeming qualities made me give it a better score than it deserves.",14 September 2015
110,The trailers are much sad and better.,Razil Akhtar,This movie is not what it pretends to be. It's yet another teenage romance tied with cancer this time around to make the audience invest in it and get depressed and cry their eyes out. Guess what? It does a very bad job of it.<br><br>The story is completely bullshit and makes no sense whatsoever. You will get that point if you are living in an actual world and not in the make believe world of Hollywood. <br><br>The trailers I watched which made me compelled to see this movie are way better and interesting than the movie itself! And the run time of 150 plus minutes is something I don't even want to talk about because I have already wasted enough time of my precious life.<br><br>Trust me there's nothing in this movie which is something you should see. It's boring as hell and utter nonsense.,7 September 2015
